Constraints: - Do NOT reorder clauses or phrases - Do NOT change sentence structure - Do NOT simplify or elaborate - Replace content words with synonyms only - Keep function words and connectives unchanged where possible Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} Variant: {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: 1000011000101111 In base 5, what is 1113003 + 11024? 1124032 In base 10, what is -5 + -183667? -183672 In base 9, what is -5 + -137788? -137804 In base 16, what is -1c + -1c5f9? -1c5f9 In base 9, what is -12 - -263764? 263752 In base 4, what is -1322231303 - -11? -1322231302 In base 16, what is -1 + -1a4f5? -1a4f6 In base 16, what is -1 + -2a9c9? -2a9ca In base 7, what is -5 + -353365? -353373 In base 16, what is -1 + -1c6c5? -1c6c6 In base 3, what is -12 - -121220221212? 121220221200 In base 5, what is -10 - -13431342? 13431332 In base 8, what is -4 + -124575? -124603 In base 3, what is -12 - -1112011201201? 1112011201112 In base 8, what is -3 + -105650? -105653 In base 14, what is -1 + -1d6a6? -1d6a7 In base 14, what is -3 - -1b5",
      "{QUESTION_CONTEXT} {INSTRUCTION} You are a syntax-preserving paraphraser that performs lexical substitution only. Objective: Rewrite using alternative vocabulary while maintaining the exact syntactic template. Rules: - Preserve all grammatical dependencies - Keep clause structure unchanged - Maintain sentence type (statement/question) - Use different words with equivalent meaning - Do NOT alter logical connectors Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} Rewrite: {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: 1000011000101111 In base 5, what is 1113003 + 11024? 1124032 In base 10, what is -1 + -189970? -189971 In base 9, what is -1 - -336737? 336736 In base 7, what is -5 - -156664? 156656 In base 6, what is -5 - -15544535? 15544530 In base 8, what is -3 - -206522? 206517 In base 8, what is -1 - -270746? 270745 In base 8, what is -2 + -262357? -262361 In base 15, what is -1 + -1c5c7? -1c5c8 In base 15, what is -1 + -1c7a1? -1c7a2 In base 2, what is -111011000111001101 - -101? -111011000111001000 In base 6, what is -4 - -13054450? 13054442 In base 3, what is -12 - -120112221201? 120112221122 In base 15, what is -1 + -1a5c7? -1a5c8 In base 4, what is -13 - -13130313? 13130300 In base 16, what is -3 - -1f7b5? 1f7b2 In base 8, what is -4 - -137576? 137572 In base 8,",

Constraints: - Do NOT reorder clauses or phrases - Do NOT change sentence structure - Do NOT simplify or elaborate - Replace content words with synonyms only - Keep function words and connectives unchanged where possible Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} Variant: {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: 54*f = -65001 - 114767 for f. -92 Solve 14*t + 7*t - 2*t = -4*t - 648 for t. -24 Solve -7*y + 17*y - 16*y = -15*y - 756 for y. -42 Solve -13*n + 3*n + 13*n + 8*n = -14 for n. -2 Solve -27*a + 15*a - 7*a = -5*a + 744 for a. -44 Solve -29*i - 8*i - 6*i = -i + 2040 for i. -45 Solve -17*z - 6*z - z - 2*z = -1680 for z. 60 Solve -6*c + 7*c - 4*c - 2*c = -2*c for c. 0 Solve -19*v - 6*v - 12*v - 10*v = -15*v for v. 0 Solve -10*u + 6*u + u = -0*u - u for u. 0 Solve -9*s - 7*s + 8*s = -10*s - 60 for s. -15 Solve -28*a - 12*a - 5*a = -a - 1032 for a. 24 Solve -5*",
      "{QUESTION_CONTEXT} {INSTRUCTION} You are a syntax-preserving paraphraser that performs lexical substitution only. Objective: Rewrite using alternative vocabulary while maintaining the exact syntactic template. Rules: - Preserve all grammatical dependencies - Keep clause structure unchanged - Maintain sentence type (statement/question) - Use different words with equivalent meaning - Do NOT alter logical connectors Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} Rewrite: {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: 54*f = -65001 - 114767 for f. -92 Solve -16*c - 7*c + 2*c = -5*c - 144 for c. 8 Solve -7*i + 4*i = -4*i + i + 40 for i. 20 Solve -13*n - 15*n + 3*n = -n - 840 for n. 40 Solve -14*z - 6*z = -6*z - 7*z - 35 for z. 5 Solve -15*t + 6*t + 16*t + 7*t = -48 for t. -3 Solve -28*a - 7*a + 6*a = -0*a - 945 for a. 27 Solve -17*s + 8*s + 3*s = -6*s - 48 for s. -12 Solve -9*u + 20*u - 6*u = -3*u - 72 for u. -9 Solve -10*v - 9*v - 6*v = -v - 744 for v. 33 Solve -5*y - y - 6*y = -y - 189 for y. 21 Solve -5*z + 6*z - 7*z = -4*z for z. 0 Solve -23*f - 23*f + 10*f = -12*",
