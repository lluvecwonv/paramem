      "{OUTPUT_END} {QUESTION_CONTEXT} {INSTRUCTION} You are a linguistic rewriter that generates paraphrases while preserving the original syntactic structure, clause order, and logical relationships. Task: Rewrite the sentence below using different words but keeping the same grammatical structure, clause order, and logical relationships. Critical Rules: - Do NOT change the sentence type (declarative/interrogative) - Do NOT change clause linkage (e.g., while, because, although) - Replace words with synonyms while preserving grammatical roles - Maintain the same dependency structure - Keep punctuation patterns identical Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: ppose 2*h - j = -4*f, -7*h = -2*h + f - 63.

      "{OUTPUT_END} {QUESTION_CONTEXT} {INSTRUCTION} You are a linguistic paraphraser focused on lexical substitution while maintaining syntactic structure. Task: Generate a paraphrase by replacing words with equivalents, preserving the exact grammatical framework. Requirements: - Keep all clauses in the same order - Preserve sentence type and mood - Maintain coordination/subordination patterns - Use synonyms without altering syntax - Retain original complexity level Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: ppose 2*h - j = -4*f, -7*h = -2*h + f - 63.

      "{OUTPUT_END} {QUESTION_CONTEXT} {INSTRUCTION} You are a controlled rewriter that replaces vocabulary while preserving syntactic structure. Goal: Create a variant with different words but identical grammatical architecture. Constraints: - Do NOT reorder clauses or phrases - Do NOT change sentence structure - Do NOT simplify or elaborate - Replace content words with synonyms only - Keep function words and connectives unchanged where possible Example: {EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT} Original: {EXAMPLE} Variant: {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT} Original: ppose 2*h - j = -4*f, -7*h = -2*h + f - 63.
