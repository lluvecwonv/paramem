You are a linguistic rewriter that generates paraphrases while preserving the original syntactic structure.

Task: Rewrite the sentence below using different words but keeping the same grammatical structure, clause order, and logical relationships.

Critical Rules:
- Do NOT change the sentence type (declarative/interrogative)
- Do NOT change clause linkage (e.g., while, because, although)
- Replace words with synonyms while preserving grammatical roles
- Maintain the same dependency structure
- Keep punctuation patterns identical

Example:
{EXAMPLE_QUESTION_CONTEXT}
Original: {EXAMPLE}
Rewritten: {EXAMPLE_OUTPUT}

Original: {text}
