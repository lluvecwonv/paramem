{"text": "Experiment 1: separate predictions\n==================================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nHuman perception is currently understood as a complex and active process. This mainly relates to the fact that the processing of incoming information is heavily and already early biased by what we have experienced before. The current research investigates underlying mechanisms, involving knowledge stored as internal representations of the environment. The knowledge shapes the structuring of new information to infer its causes and leads to interpretations (perceptual inference); it also predicts outcomes of the currently experienced situation (den Ouden et al., [@B12]). The predictive principle can improve behavioral adaptation in this situation due to facilitation and speeding-up the processing (Bar, [@B4]; Bubic et al., [@B9]; Wacongne et al., [@B52a]; Arnal and Giraud, [@B3]; Clark, [@B10]). The internal representations work as generative models, i.e., they predict upcoming events on basis of experienced rules of the environment (Bar, [@B4]; Winkler et al., [@B58]; Bendixen et al., [@B5]; Clark, [@B10]). The predictive coding theory assumes that predictions of future events are sent to hierarchically lower levels to be matched with ascending information.

According to both the structures of the variable regulatory domains and the cofactor dependencies, PKCs are classified into the following categories: conventional PKCs (cPKCs; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), novel PKCs (nPKCs; \u025b, \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b7) and atypical PKCs (aPKCs; \u03b6, \u03b9) [@bib0015]. cPKCs require Ca^2+^ and diacylglycerol (DAG) for activation; however, nPKCs are Ca^2+^ independent and aPKCs do not require Ca^2+^ or DAG for their activation.

During plant growth and development, the chromatin structure in the nuclei must be precisely modulated in coordination with the transcriptional reprogramming associated with cell proliferation and cell fate determination within meristem regions. Nucleosomes, which are the basic structural and functional units of chromatin, comprise approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a globular histone octamer, each containing two molecules of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 \\[[@B1-ijms-21-00771]\\]. Nucleosomes are connected by a 20--200 bp DNA linker and form repeating structures that appear as \"beads-on-a-string\" in electron microscopy images. The nucleosome array is further compacted into a more condensed and highly heterogeneous structure, and the DNA dynamics are generally correlated with local chromatin accessibility.

During the past 40 years, technical advances have allowed for dramatic changes of monitoring of metabolic control.

Since 1975, technical advances allowed for radical changes in glucose monitoring. In 1971 the first blood glucose monitor for point-of-care use in patients with diabetes was patented in the USA by Anton Clemens: the Ames Reflectance Meter. It was based on optical detection of a color change on glucose oxidase-based strips, and was succeeded by the Ames Eytone, which became commonplace in physicians' offices and hospitals.

Foundry waste mainly includes spent foundry sands (SFS). Moreover foundries also generate other waste such as dust and sludge from dust collectors, smelter slags, residue of refractory materials and spent grinding materials. About 600,000 tonnes of foundry waste are produced annually in Poland, including about 500,000 tonnes are waste from the iron foundry. Foundry waste, especially SFS, can be reused, e.g. in foundry production, in the construction and road industry. In addition, the use of SFS as a soil substitute is popular in the US and other countries (Dungan et al. [@CR20]; Dayton et al. [@CR15]).

Because of the widespread resistance of *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria parasite species to chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated *falciparum* malaria since 2005 ([@B2]).\n\nParasite-based diagnosis is desirable before use of ACT because over-prescription of ACT, which is much more expensive than using conventional drugs, is a great threat to cost-effective intervention. Moreover, parasitological diagnosis can reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions as well as unnecessary drug pressure to malaria parasites. In most remote rural health facilities in malaria-endemic regions, however, microscopic diagnosis is limited, and malaria diagnosis has traditionally relied much on the history of fever and symptom-based diagnosis.

Its concentration in the brain is relatively low compared to that found in the most glycogenic tissues, namely liver and skeletal muscle. Within the brain, glycogen is stored mainly in astrocytes ([@B7]), although neurons also contain a small but functionally important amount ([@B29]). Brain glycogen is crucial for neuronal survival and synaptic activity during stress episodes such as hypoglycemia and ischemia ([@B39]; [@B37]), but also in euglycemic conditions during periods of increased brain activity ([@B35]; [@B5]). In this regard, regions of high synaptic activity contain greater glycogen stores ([@B30]). Astrocytes need glycogen-derived energy to sustain neuronal function by regulating the concentration of neurotransmitters and ions in the synaptic cleft ([@B43]; [@B40]). Thus, inhibition of glycogenolysis raises extracellular glutamate concentrations ([@B31]). In addition, several reports propose that astrocytes metabolize glycogen to lactate, which is then supplied to neurons for oxidative metabolism, in what is known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis ([@B26]).

From an engineering perspective, the installations employing technologies based on aerobic granular sludge require a smaller surface area and clarifier dimensions, shorter standstill for settling, and a longer time for the biological removal of pollutants.

INTRODUCTION {#phy214377-sec-0001}\n===============\n\nRadiation therapy is used to treat a variety of pelvic cancers, including prostate and cervical cancer (Society AC, [2016](#phy214377-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"}). While radiation can be very effective, it can also damage benign tissue in the radiation field, causing long\u2010term side effects. Radiation\u2010induced bladder damage can result in a condition called radiation cystitis (RC, also known as hemorrhagic cystitis). The reported incidence of RC ranges from 23%--80% due to the variability in types and doses of radiation (Browne et al., [2015](#phy214377-bib-0003){ref-type=\"ref\"}). A recent study reported an incidence of RC of 10% in prostate cancer survivors that had received radiation therapy (Martin et al., [2019](#phy214377-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The incidence of RC is higher in men due to the frequent use of"}
{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\nMatrine, the major active component of the traditional Chinese medicine *Sophora flavescens*, has been used to treat jaundice, reduce liver enzyme activity, and prevent hepatic fibrosis [@B1],[@B2]. In recent years, studies have indicated that matrine also inhibits tumor cell proliferation [@B3], and induces cellular differentiation [@B4] and apoptosis [@B5]. Our previous study showed that matrine could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in human malignant melanoma A375 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it effectively suppressed their adhesion and invasiveness *in vitro* [@B6]. However, like most low molecular weight drugs, matrine is able to freely traverse in and out of blood vessels to distribute to non-tumor tissues, resulting in accumulation in the liver, spleen or kidneys, diminishing its effects on cancer cells. In addition, consistent with the results of other research groups, our previous study also showed that matrine had fewer side-effects and broader indications compared with conventional anti-cancer drugs. However, its anti-tumor activity was moderate, and its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was about 2.01mM [@B6].\n\nIn order to improve the tumor-specificity and efficacy of anti-tumor drugs, liposomes have been used extensively as delivery systems in both pre-clinical and clinical applications.

This commonly results in Wallerian degeneration (Conforti et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2019), first discovered by Waller (1851). The discovery of WLDS protein in strains of mice resistant to axonal degeneration (Mack et al., 2001; Coleman and Freeman, 2010; Williams et al., 2017) convinced researchers that Wallerian degeneration is a programmed cell event (Gerdts et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). In normal mice, immediately after peripheral nerves suffer trauma, Wallerian degeneration begins (Girouard et al., 2018); the disintegration of axonal structures occurs (Geden and Deshmukh, 2016; Simon et al., 2016), atrophy of fiber tracts is observed and macrophages and Schwann cells infiltrate (Liou et al., 2011; Simon et al., 2016; Zigmond and Echevarria, 2019).\n\nIn the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells wrap around the nerve fibers and secrete neurotrophins to protect and nourish the peripheral nerves (Kennedy and Zochodne, 2005; Jortner, 2019).

The design of feedback controllers to control biochemical processes has received significant attention in the literature (see. e.g. [@bib0110], [@bib0005]), and the construction of synthetic control circuits has become a major focus of research in the new field of synthetic biology. Ideally, such circuits should be made up of well-defined modules consisting only of molecular reactions, in order to allow the realisation of embedded biomolecular control systems ([@bib0040]). A promising approach to facilitating the design of such circuits is provided by nucleic acid-based chemistry, wherein the design of biomolecular circuits can be done using abstract chemical reaction network (CRN) theory (e.g. [@bib0170]), and then translated to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using strand displacement reactions for implementations ([@bib0035]).

In other words, cementum is a part of the tooth, but functionally, it belongs to the dental attachment apparatus \\[[@B2-ijms-16-03188]\\]. The integrity of cementum could be affected by bacterial endotoxin deposition in periodontitis, and the diseased cementum is often eliminated during periodontal therapy \\[[@B3-ijms-16-03188]\\]. Therefore, one main goal of periodontal therapy is to form new cementum and to restore periodontal attachment.

Since the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates the cell response to environmental signals, the local environment of the matrix is of great importance in order to maintain the homeostasis of cementum.

{"text": "Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nWhen we consider end-of-life patients under palliative care, there is a tendency to think of patients with terminal cancer; indeed, in practice, palliative care is mainly focused on this type of patient. However, given current demographic changes, with progressive population ageing and longer survival, advanced chronic illnesses are becoming the leading cause of patients requiring end-of-life care. At the same time, we should consider that the palliative care model involves starting to take certain measures well before advanced stages of illness leading towards death. Ideally, palliative care should overlap with curative treatments in cases of poor prognosis, this being considered a more comprehensive patient-centred approach, taking into account not only clinical but also psychosocial and existential needs. Its objective is to avoid discomfort and suffering in the wider sense, improving quality of life as much as possible and avoiding unnecessary treatments.\n\nThe two best examples of this situation are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF), due to their prevalence and the percentage of patients in final and irreversible stages. However, as we will discuss below, it is difficult to define the terminal state, and the most common scenario is that such patients are not"}

{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nObesity is a growing global public health challenge with 650 million adults worldwide estimated to be obese ([@bib67]). The accompanying changes in the levels and balance of fatty acids are key components of metabolic syndrome, a multiplex risk factor underlying cardiovascular disease that includes as cofactors insulin resistance and chronic inflammatory states ([@bib15]). In turn, both insulin resistance and meta-inflammation---a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response in metabolic tissues---are speculated to be consequences of the increased uptake of dietary fatty acids and changes in the dietary balance of fatty acids that accompany obesity ([@bib13]; [@bib50]). Meta-inflammation is characterized by elevated inflammatory cytokine levels ([@bib20]), enhanced proinflammatory signaling, and macrophage activation ([@bib42]). Meta-inflammation in combination with changes in fatty acid flux has been proposed to antagonise insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance ([@bib68]; [@bib70]; [@bib55]). Under normal conditions, engagement of the conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway leads to Akt activation and the phosphorylation of FOXO (Forkhead box O) transcription factors (TFs).

Nonetheless, the surge of methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) outbreaks has caused a major setback in nosocomial infections.

{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nProtein Ubiquitination\n----------------------\n\nUbiquitin is a highly conserved small modular protein consisting of 76 amino acids that can be attached to other proteins as a post translational modification (PTM). Ubiquitination can modulate the properties of the target molecule, such as its cellular localization, interaction partners, protein activity, or it can send the target protein for degradation. As such ubiquitination controls major cellular processes including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle, protein turnover, and stress response. Protein ubiquitination is selectively mediated via the sequential action of three enzymes. First, ubiquitin is activated by a thioester bond formation with an internal active site cysteine residue of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in an ATP dependent manner. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 enzyme to the cysteine residue of an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Finally, an E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to specific target proteins (Hershko and Ciechanover, [@B28]). More than 600 different E3 ligases have been identified and they account for a high selectivity toward target protein ubiquitination. There are three main types of E3 ligases: RING/U-box ligases, RING-between-RING (RBR) ligases and HECT ligases, which have a different mode of action for the transfer"}

Human functional imaging studies have localized these face-sensitive regions to lateral occipital cortex (LOC), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and, more selectively, part of the middle fusiform gyrus, which has been labeled the fusiform face area (FFA) ([@bib42]).

Voluntary attention is the major top-down influence for this selection process. It can lead to improved processing of attended locations, objects, and features, such as decreased reaction times (RTs) and higher accuracy rates for attended compared to unattended sensory signals (e.g., Posner, [@B29]).

Microbial pattern recognition by host-encoded immune receptors is essential for the activation of plant antimicrobial defenses. Perception by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) [@ppat.1004491-Boller1], [@ppat.1004491-Dodds1]. PTI is an ancient form of plant immunity that provides protection to host non-adapted pathogens, but limited or basal immunity to host-adapted microbes only. In addition, plant-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released either by the deleterious activities of secreted microbial enzymes or toxins that activate plant PTI in a PRR-dependent manner [@ppat.1004491-Boller1], [@ppat.1004491-Ottmann1]. Host-adapted plant pathogens employ effectors to suppress PTI and to establish infection [@ppat.1004491-Dou1].

All contributors to the book are nursing instructors at American universities. Fast Fact chapbooks are designed to fill a gap in health education. In this case, the gap is the lack of historical content in contemporary nursing programmes. A foreword by Marilyn Klainberg states the purpose of the book, which is to introduce the historical and global foundations of nursing to those in the profession today. Klainberg maintains that contemporary nursing is a product of its history which has been shaped by global events such as politics, wars, religion, travel and the environment.\n\nStressing that the current literature on the history of nursing is not written from a global perspective, this book is intended to fill that gap. A preface by Deborah Dolan Hunt is a plea for including historical content in nursing curricula."}

[@bib6] showed that the relative proportion of eumelanin and pheomelanin was controlled by activity of the enzyme tyrosinase. Lower levels of activity favour production of pheomelanin, while higher levels favour eumelanin. What is more, tyrosinase activity is stimulated by tyrosine (Tyr) concentration, with an increase leading to greater eumelanin production, as shown by [@bib13]. Tyrosine can come directly from the diet, or from the hydroxylation of phenylalanine ([@bib11]).

INTRODUCTION {#ece34633-sec-0001}\n===============\n\nCharacterizing individual variability in population dynamic rates is an important consideration in ecological studies.

In many species, survival rates can vary by orders of magnitude across all age classes, or can change markedly at various life\u2010history stages. This correlation between age and survival is likely linked to size, as older individuals tend to be larger and less vulnerable to predation. On the other hand, all animal species have a life span that is limited by aging rather than extrinsic factors (P\u00e9ron et\u00a0al., [2010](#ece34633-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Understanding this variation in survivorship across ages can provide information on population dynamics such as the proportion of new recruits that will survive to reproductive age, impacts of management interventions on population dynamics, and how to target harvesting efforts to maximize sustainability (Berkeley, Hixon, Larson, & Love, [2004](#ece34633-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nOur motivation for wanting to understand size and age\u2010related survival came from a study"}

To maintain the normal length of the female's reproductive life, the majority of primordial follicles must remain in a quiescent state for later use [@pone.0039034-Hirshfield1]--[@pone.0039034-Reddy1]. A highly controlled, but poorly understood, mechanism ensures that only a limited number of primordial follicles are activated at any given time to provide a steady supply of fertilizable oocytes that are available at regular intervals. However, during the pathological conditions such as premature ovarian failure (POF), there is an accelerated depletion of primordial follicles [@pone.0039034-BeckPeccoz1], [@pone.0039034-Jagarlamudi1].

Optogenetics, visible light-based stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express light-gated channels and ion pumps, provides genetic targeting of specific cell types in combination with rapid stimulation ([@bib6]; [@bib9]).

In mammals, melatonin signals through two receptors of the G-protein-coupled super-family, termed MT1 and MT2 [@pone.0090056-Dubocovich1]. Compared to adults, foetuses and neonates exhibit a more widespread receptor distribution, suggesting that melatonin may have as yet unknown roles in development [@pone.0090056-Davis1]. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms controlling these developmental changes in melatonin signalling.\n\nPineal melatonin production is driven by the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and thus exhibits a robust daily rhythm. This rhythm varies in proportion to the length of the night and so melatonin encodes both daily and seasonal time [@pone.0090056-Reiter2]. In mammals, melatonin is essential for photoperiodic physiology and can regulate circadian clock gene expression in several peripheral tissues [@pone.0090056-Johnston1]--[@pone.0090056-TorresFarfan1], indicating a possible ability to synchronise peripheral circadian clocks.

In this system, ubiquitin, a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids, is covalently linked to a target protein through an enzymatic cascade, and the assembly of a poly-ubiquitin chain typically specifies that target protein for rapid degradation via the 26S proteasome [@pgen.1003375-Hershko2]. The system can rapidly turn \"off\" regulatory proteins with high selectivity and is essential for numerous cellular processes such as transcription, signaling, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and differentiation. Not surprisingly, defects in the ubiquitin-proteolytic system have been implicated in a number of human diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders [@pgen.1003375-Welcker1]--[@pgen.1003375-Lee1].\n\nAn enzymatic cascade of three enzymes mediates the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate protein: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase (E3) [@pgen.1003375-Ye1].

Traditionally, the main applications of sequence alignments have included phylogenetic tree reconstruction, Hidden Markov Modeling (profiles), secondary or tertiary structure prediction, function prediction and many minor but useful applications such as PCR primer design and data validation. With the notable exception of ribosomal RNA, a large majority of these applications are based on the analysis of protein sequences, possibly back-translated into nucleic acid sequences in the context of phylogenetic analysis. While this type of approaches still constitutes the vast majority of published applications for MSAs, recent biological discoveries coupled with the massive delivery of functional, structural and genomic data are rapidly expanding the potential scope of alignment methods. In order to make the best of the available data, sequence aligners will have to evolve and become able to deal with a very large number of sequences or integrate highly heterogeneous information types such as evolutionary, structural and functional data.

Prospective longitudinal studies have found that self-reported depressive rumination predicts the likelihood, severity, and duration of syndromal depression ([@c21]; [@c32]).\n\nOne potential mechanism by which depressive rumination may contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression is via influencing emotional reactivity. Emotional reactivity is conceptualized as the change in the quality and intensity of affect in response to an emotionally evocative event, such as change in despondency following a failure (e.g., [@c30]; [@c53]). Experimental studies have found that induction of depressive rumination intensifies dysphoric mood, increases negative thinking, and impairs problem solving relative to distraction in individuals already in a dysphoric mood, but has no differential effect in individuals who are not already dysphoric (e.g., [@c13]; [@c22]).

{"text": "1. Introduction {#sec0005}\n===============\n\nCytokines are a broad and loose group of small cell-signaling proteins that play important roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammatory response. They include interferons (IFN), interleukins (IL), chemokines, lymphokines, and tumor necrosis factors (TNF). They are produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, mast cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells. Cytokines that are produced at the site of infection stimulate and coordinate innate and adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens ([@bib0135], [@bib0185], [@bib0365]). They act through their matching receptors on the surface of target cells, followed by cascades of intracellular signaling. One such frequently activated intracellular signaling is the JAK-STAT pathway, which is indispensable and pivotal in many biological processes including immunity and inflammatory response ([@bib0275], [@bib0340]). Dysregulation of JAK-STAT signaling results in immunodeficiency and immune-mediated disorders ([@bib0270], [@bib0275]). Mutations in the components of JAK-STAT pathway cause immunodeficient and autoimmune disorders ([@bib0050], [@bib0190]).

Neural differentiation of PC12 has been widely used as a neuron cell model in neuroscience, such as in the nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain model ([@b5-ijmm-41-01-0195]) and nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity model ([@b6-ijmm-41-01-0195]). NGF induces differentiation of PC12 cells by acting through the TrkA receptor ([@b7-ijmm-41-01-0195]).\n\nDifferentiation of PC12 cells is assessed by semi-quantitative or quantitative morphological methods.

{"text": "INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nIron, used as a redox center by many enzymes, is an essential trace metal required by almost all living organisms. The intracellular level of free catalytically active iron is typically kept low due to its toxic effects. Free ferrous iron reacts with hydrogen peroxide, a natural by-product of aerobic respiration, to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH**^\u22c5^**) via the Fenton reaction ([@B1]). Due to this potentially damaging property of iron, there exists an intricate balance between iron transport, utilization, and storage. Most bacteria possess mechanisms to import iron in its oxidized ferric state (Fe^3+^), reduced ferrous state (Fe^2+^), or both (for reviews, see references [@B2] and [@B3]). The solubility of these two iron forms differs drastically at neutral pH: ferric iron has extremely low solubility at 10^\u221218^ M, whereas ferrous iron is readily soluble at 10^\u22121^ M. To take up ferric iron, bacteria have developed high-affinity ferric iron chelators called siderophores to capture, solubilize, and deliver insoluble iron into the cell ([@B4]). Unlike the Fe^3+^ transport system, which requires a number of proteins involved in siderophore synthesis and Fe^3+^ siderophore acquisition, the Fe^2+^ transport system appears to consist of mainly one protein, FeoB ([@B5]).
