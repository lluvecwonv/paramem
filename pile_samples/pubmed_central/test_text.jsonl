Benefits of forming such associations are considered in terms of predator detection and avoidance, increased foraging efficiency, and reproductive advantages (reviewed in Stensland et al. [@CR55]).

Evidently, only a minority of candidates passes all these obstacles, is permitted to clinical trials, accepted by regulatory agencies, and converted into a commercial product. The development of allergy vaccines faces additional problems, because unlike prophylactic vaccination, allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) attempts to counteract an already established pathological immune response [@pone.0017278-Rolland1].

{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\nEver since the BOLD effect was described, fMRI has dominated neuroscience as a mean to evaluate brain activity ([@B32],[@B31], [@B33]). It allows mapping of signal changes generated by the mismatch between oxygen delivery and consumption upon neuronal activation. While providing significant insight into brain function, a major limitation of BOLD is that it is an indirect measure and is affected by subject-specific haemodynamic factors. Thus, an approach that could directly measure neuronal activity in humans *in vivo*, non-invasively, would have a major advantage over BOLD-fMRI.\n\nIn this paper, we propose that, thanks to sodium MRI technology, we are within reach of measuring directly a local transient change of sodium ions (23Na) concentration in the intracellular space. During activity, neuronal action potentials cause a transient 23Na flux from the extracellular to intracellular space over a temporal scale of several milliseconds. If sodium imaging, dynamically repeated, was successful in detecting 23Na concentration changes evoked by specific tasks, it would open up a new way of investigating human brain function, complementing BOLD-fMRI.\n\nImaging aspects of the brain electrical activity, other than BOLD, related to transmembrane sodium-potassium ion exchange during depolarization could provide a direct access to primary brain function everywhere.

Hearing threshold, the lowest sound pressure level (SPL) detectable by a receiver, is an important factor for all functions of acoustic communication because a receiver must first detect an auditory signal prior to responding. It is especially critical for mate choice because if an animal is calling or singing for mates but receivers do not hear it, we can ask rhetorically, is the sender even sending a signal?\n\nHearing threshold is also a critical variable for determining a signal's active space, the distance over which receivers can detect a signal ([@zoy089-B59]; [@zoy089-B14]; [@zoy089-B53]; [@zoy089-B10]).

Multiple functions emerge when materials evolve under harsh conditions, for instance, many natural marine glues exhibit added bond toughness to withstand dynamic ocean currents or wave action at the seashore. For sessile marine organisms such as barnacles, oysters and tubeworms, the adhesive is required to function for a lifetime and persists long afterwards. Such permanent adhesives use inventive adaptations to achieve durability, such as hierarchical structuring and chemical modification at the molecular and supramolecular level[@b1][@b2].

However, 3D virtual planning of orthognathic surgery still suffers from the disadvantages CBCT imaging has. For orthognathic surgery a good representation of the dental surfaces as well as the occlusion is needed for the 3D planning to properly position the jaws and to reach a stable occlusion. In CBCT imaging visualization of the dentition is still difficult. Loubelle and co-workers and Schulze and co-workers showed that the density of enamel is so high, that it gives rise to artefacts around the teeth [@pone.0059130-Loubele1], [@pone.0059130-Schulze1].

There are two principal etiologies for such symptoms: delayed transit through the colon and impaired evacuation of the rectum. Impaired rectal evacuation can result from mechanical or structural obstruction, but the more common cause are functional pelvic outlet obstructions, which include paradoxical contraction or inadequate relaxation of pelvic floor muscle during defecation (pelvic floor dyssynergia, PFD) and failure to increase intrarectal pressure during evacuation \\[[@B1],[@B2]\\].\n\nDynamic defecography is a fluoroscopic procedure used to observe rectal evacuation of contrast paste, in order to assess changing anatomic relationships of the pelvic floor and associated organs. Thus, it is particularly relevant in those patients who complain of difficult stool passage and usually performed to diagnose functional pelvic outlet obstruction. This test is generally known to be sensitive and specific for PFD, and recommended in situations when other anorectal physiologic test results differ from clinical impression \\[[@B2]-[@B4]\\].

{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is a human tumor of B cell origin whose pathogenesis involves complementation between a defined cellular genetic change, translocation of the c-myc oncogene into an active immunoglobulin (Ig) locus, and a B cell-transforming virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [@ppat.1000341-Brady1],[@ppat.1000341-Kelly1]. C-myc deregulation appears to be the crucial lymphomagenic event, since all BLs worldwide carry a c-myc/Ig translocation, and in model systems, expression of c-myc from such a construct converts B cells to the proliferating BL phenotype [@ppat.1000341-Polack1]--[@ppat.1000341-Zhu1]. There is, nevertheless, strong selection for EBV as a complementing agent. Thus all cases of BL in its high incidence (endemic) form are EBV genome-positive, as are 15--85% of the low/intermediate incidence (sporadic) BLs seen elsewhere in the world [@ppat.1000341-Magrath1].

Moreover, recent studies of children and adolescents (e.g., [@b8-15-21]; [@b16-15-21]; [@b39-15-21]) have shown that attention to and liking of alcohol advertising are related to (1) greater knowledge about alcohol slogans and beer brands, (2) more favorable beliefs about drinking, (3) increased intentions to drink as an adult, and (4) increased drinking.

These points consist of a period of negligible movements, and the goal of the task is to arrive at these points in accordance with the isochronous (repetitive) metronome signal. The task can be divided into two distinct phases: Synchronization that consists of actively moving in accordance with the metronome, or continuation where the metronome is turned off and the participant attempts to maintain a previously provided metronome rhythm for a given period [@pone.0069353-Wing1], [@pone.0069353-Aschersleben1].

{"text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n==============\n\nMost cellular processes require a large number of proteins to assemble into functional complexes to perform their activity. Therefore, describing functional protein complexes taking part in given processes is critical to the underlying molecular mechanism understanding. Experimental protocols such as Affinity Purification followed by Mass-Spectrometry (AP-MS) have been devised to *pull down* a protein of interest (*bait*) together with all the interacting proteins within the same protein complex (*preys*). However, these sets of *preys* may contain both false positives, proteins detected despite not actually interacting with the *bait*, and omit false negatives ([@btu517-B4]), proteins interacting in the cellular context studied but not detected. Effective control experiments and usage of contaminants repositories can remove some false positives. However, false negative interacting partners identification, thereby the definition of the entire protein complex, remains challenging.

{"text": "1 Introduction\n==============\n\nAutomatic gene function annotation is an important first step to interpret genomic data. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a widely used reference knowledge base, which helps investigate genomic functions by linking genes to biological knowledge such as metabolic pathways and molecular networks ([@btz859-B4]). In KEGG, the KEGG Orthology (KO) database---a manually curated large collection of protein families (i.e. KO families)---serves as a baseline reference to link genes with other KEGG resources such as metabolic maps through *K* number identifiers. Currently, KOs are assigned to 12\u00a0934\u00a0525 (48%) protein sequences in the KEGG GENES database (27\u00a0173\u00a0868 proteins).

These tools use homology search software such as BLAST ([@btz859-B1]) and GHOSTX ([@btz859-B8]) to search amino acid sequences against GENES. To reduce the lengthy computational times required for multiple pairwise sequence comparisons, these tools use selected representative sequences from GENES to build their target database.

Microtubule minus ends can grow and shrink in vitro[@R2], however, it is generally believed that within mitotic spindles, minus ends are either stable or slowly depolymerize, resulting in poleward microtubule flux[@R3]. The molecular mechanisms controlling microtubule minus-end behavior in the spindle are poorly understood.\n\nPrevious work indicated that ASPM (known as Asp in fly and ASPM-1 in worm) is an excellent candidate for being a mitotic microtubule minus-end regulator[@R4]--[@R13]. It is encoded by the gene that is most frequently mutated in microcephaly[@R14], but the molecular mechanism underlying ASPM activity is not understood. Katanin, a conserved microtubule-severing protein complex, which consists of the AAA ATPase containing enzymatic subunit p60 and the regulatory subunit p80[@R15]--[@R17], is also linked to microcephaly[@R18],[@R19]. Formation of the katanin p60/p80 heterodimer is mediated by the N-terminal Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking domain of p60 and a conserved C-terminal domain of p80[@R20].

We proposed to evaluate the efficacy of regional anesthesia to decrease narcotic consumption, and to assess the impact on hospitalization costs via meta-analysis. We hypothesized that regional anesthesia at donor sites would significantly decrease pain and narcotic consumption, as well as decrease total hospital costs compared to non-regional pain management.\n\n**METHODS:** Using PRISMA criteria, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and ScienceDirect were searched with the following inclusion criteria: comparative studies, adult populations, burn patients, autologous skin grafting, regional nerve blocks and traditional narcotic regimens. MINORS criteria assessed methodological rigor of included studies. Outcomes assessed included narcotic consumption, pain scores, and opioid side effects. Meta-analysis obtained pooled values for morphine consumption and side effects.

In case of a difficult intubation, a similar strategy of \"railroading\" an ETT over an intubating catheter (IC) is a basic principle of securing the airway. In addition to functioning as a guide for the ETT, some AECs and ICs have a central lumen through which oxygen can be delivered.\n\nFlow resistance in a small-bore AEC or IC is high, however, so oxygen must be insufflated at high pressure. With conventional high-pressure (i.e., jet) ventilation devices that are used to inject oxygen through such catheters, the injected gas volume cannot be estimated. Also, because of its flow resistance, exhalation through small-bore catheters is limited. Thus, the absence of a patent airway allowing egress of air around the AEC/IC is a relative contraindication for oxygen injection into the lungs. Despite this contraindication, these catheters are still typically used in patients whose airways may become compromised due to obstruction (e.g., tissue swelling or hematoma).[@CR2] In such patients, expiration time is prolonged, and complete"}

For example, chicks with lateralized processing of visual information can attend to two tasks at the same time (viz., searching for grains of food while monitoring overhead for a potential predator), whereas chicks not lateralized in this way perform poorly on both aspects of the task[@b1]. A similar result has also been found in a comparison of lateralized and non-lateralized fish[@b2]. Pigeons, also, are more efficient at finding grain amongst non-food items (grit) if they are more strongly lateralized[@b3].

Although several hypotheses tried to explain the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease, the exact cause of RLN remains uncertain. The pathology is described as a distal axonopathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve with lesions of demyelination but also some degree of remyelination.

{"text": "Background/introduction\n=======================\n\nHistotripsy ablation of liver tumors is a non-invasive surgery that uses high-intensity acoustic pulses to control an inertial cavitation cloud. Repeated exposure to the cavitation cloud renders a target tissue into a homogenous slurry which is then gradually absorbed by the body. Like other non-invasive surgeries, histotripsy requires a feedback system that can estimate therapy location and dose in real-time. Because the time-average power output of histotripsy is very small, the treatment region does not express a significant rise in temperature, making MRI thermometry an ineffective method to actively monitor therapy. Previous work has shown that MRI pulse sequences can be made sensitive to the chaotic water flow present during inertial cavitation. This is done by synchronizing the timing of the histotripsy pulses with the timing of the sequence's gradient waveforms. Incoherent water flow caused by cavitation attenuates the MR signal through a process similar to that used in diffusion-weighted MRI.

{"text": "Knockout mouse lines that show embryonic and perinatal lethality are valuable models to investigate the genetic pathways that are associated with human congenital diseases. To elucidate the relationship between a specific gene and a developmental defect, detailed screening of knockout phenotypes is pivotal. Here, Wolfgang Weninger and colleagues used high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) to screen the morphological phenotypes of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) embryos of 34 mouse strains that produce prenatally lethal offspring. The authors developed a reliable and ergonomic screening protocol to efficiently and comprehensively score structural abnormalities in those embryos. Their approach enabled them to detect a total of 58 defects that might be missed by employing alternative three-dimensional imaging methods and scoring systems. Many of these defects might be causal to embryonic or perinatal mortality. The results demonstrate that HREM combined with a systematic screening protocol enables more efficient phenotyping of E14.5 mouse embryos than any alternative approach. Such a method will contribute to advancing our knowledge of normal tissue and organ development, and of the causality of congenital diseases. **Page 1143**\n\n![](dmm-07-10-e1002-f01){#f1-007e1002}"}

To address the increasing scarcity of fossil fuels, there are extensive research efforts focusing on sustainable and renewable energy substitutes. Among the wide array of renewable energy resources, abundant solar energy can be converted into electric power through photovoltaic (PV) technologies without inducing substantial environmental burden. To meet the stringent requirements of efficient deployment of PVs on a global scale, low manufacturing costs and enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) are urgently needed.\n\nThe emerging metal halide perovskite family has demonstrated great potential as light-harvesting active materials by virtue of excellent light absorption and charge-carrier mobilities ([@R1]).

There are already several commercial (nonperovskite) multi-junction technologies including tandems and triple- and quadruple-junction modules that typically use III to V semiconductors, with promising PCEs that rival and even outperform the benchmark silicon PVs ([@R4]).

For example, the \u03b12 regulator represses the transcription of one cell type-specific gene set to help define the \u03b1 cell phenotype. Upon the genetic switch of mating-type information, \u03b12 expression is lost; the existing pool of the \u03b12 repressor is rapidly turned over (\u03b12 half-life is \\~5 min[@R6]--[@R8]) and its regulatory targets are de-repressed, allowing the transition to a new cellular phenotype[@R3].

Running animals must effectively coordinate the interplay of swing-leg trajectory, landing conditions and stance leg loading [@pone.0100399-Daley3]--[@pone.0100399-Blum2]. For example, when running guinea fowl encounter an unexpected pothole, late-swing leg retraction leads to variation in leg contact angle, which explains 80% of the variance in stance leg impulse [@pone.0100399-Daley4]. Thus, the swing-leg trajectory is a critical factor in the dynamics of legged locomotion, particularly during movement over uneven terrain.\n\nRecent theoretical studies have highlighted inherent trade-offs in swing-leg trajectory for walking and running in uneven terrain. Simple walking and running models have revealed that swing-leg velocity just before the stance transition influences numerous aspects of locomotor dynamics, including stability [@pone.0100399-Seyfarth1]--[@pone.0100399-Blum2],"}

Specifically, individuals who are indiscriminately cooperative can be exploited by 'free riders', those who reap the benefits of cooperation without ever bearing the costs, thus undermining the success of cooperative individuals [@pone.0061804-Nowak1]. This observation has led to great interest, across many fields of inquiry, in identifying the factors that support human cooperation. Indeed, an impressive body of research in the fields of behavioral and biological sciences suggests that individuals have many ways to exploit the benefits of cooperation while mitigating the risks. Specifically, mechanisms for maintaining cooperation between unrelated individuals can be divided into at least two categories of evolutionarily stable strategies that support reciprocity, one set involving partner fidelity (partner control) and another involving partner choice [@pone.0061804-Bull1], [@pone.0061804-Baumard1].\n\nIn partner control models, the same two individuals engage in an iterated, indefinite, series of interactions.

A variety of pathological conditions can perturb the steady supply of leucocytes resulting in emergency myelopoiesis[@b1], which serves to provide cells to eliminate potential threats, either abnormal cellular growth (cancer), infectious agents or tissue damage. If these conditions resolve quickly, the balance of myeloid cells is restored without negative consequences for the host.

Understanding how this information is encoded and deciphered is a major uncompleted scientific challenge. A group of genes known as homeobox genes has emerged as important master regulators of development. These genes have been highly conserved throughout evolution. They are expressed during embryonic development in a highly co-ordinated manner and continue to be expressed in virtually all tissues and organs throughout adult life.\n\nHomeobox (*Hox)* genes were discovered following the observation of two striking mutations in the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*. In the *antennapedia* mutation the antennae are changed into legs, whereas in the bithorax mutation, the haltere (a balancing organ on the third thoracic segment) is transformed into part of a wing. These changes were described as homeotic transformations from the Greek word homeosis, signifying a change of a complete body structure into another. *Drosophila* geneticists devised the term 'homeotic selector gene' to encapsulate the concept that a master regulatory gene could control the development of each segment of the fly. Subsequently *Drosophila* was found to contain a cluster of genes consisting of the *bithorax*"}

Based on these attributes, benthic foraminifera serve as important tools for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, including estimations of organic matter fluxes in marine sediments and paleoproductivity studies (e.g. [@BIO030056C1]; [@BIO030056C29]). They mainly feed on microalgae or phytodetritus (e.g. [@BIO030056C7]; [@BIO030056C19]; [@BIO030056C39]) and their response to variations in phytodetritus fluxes can be observed on foraminiferal community compositions ([@BIO030056C27]) or metabolic activities ([@BIO030056C22]; [@BIO030056C41]).

Consequently, coliphages such as T4 and lambda served as model phages in the development of molecular tools and the fundamental understanding of phage-host interactions.

During an inflammation response, endothelial cells lining the blood vessels surrounding an infection site express adhesion proteins called selectins that are specific to leukocyte surface receptors. As the first step of the leukocyte adhesion cascade, leukocytes captured via selectin-specific interactions passively roll on the blood vessel wall under blood flow toward the inflammation site in a process known as rolling adhesion[@b1][@b2][@b3]. Malfunction of any adhesion molecules involved in this process leads to severe immune disorders such as the leukocyte adhesion deficiencies (LAD)[@b4].

This analysis was first performed in 2002 on 10,803 HIV-1 sequences available at that time and again in 2009 on an expanded 43,822 sequences. Selected epitopes were validated for binding and immunogenicity with PBMCs from HIV-infected donors in Providence, RI and Bamako, Mali.\n\nResults\n=======\n\n38 highly conserved HLA-A2 candidate epitopes were selected. Analysis done in 2009 revealed surprising stability of 25 of the epitopes selected in 2002 and identified an additional 13 highly conserved HLA-A2 candidates. Thirty-five (92%) of the 38 selected epitopes stimulated IFNg response in PBMC from at least one subject. Twenty-one of 25 peptides selected in 2002 were validated in assays performed"}

The availability of more therapeutic options represents a challenge to oncologists, who must select the best treatment for any individual. In the majority of instances, oncologists must rely on best evidence to make that selection. Using this approach, only a fraction of patients responds to any chemotherapy regimen, and this fraction diminishes with successive lines of chemotherapy due to emergence of resistance. While predictive markers may refine treatment selection, there are no predictive biomarkers for most agents. Moreover, predictive biomarkers identify individuals who do not respond, but do not guarantee benefit.\n\nAn alternative approach is to develop an improved means to assess response to systemic therapy, soon [after]{.ul} drug has been administered. Such an adaptive approach would enable the oncologist to change therapies in a timely manner, before disease progression, and before major toxicities and high costs are incurred.

Navigation and communication require multiple cognitive faculties. Among these are, for example, recognition of the sun compass, visual distance estimation, learning of multisensory cues inside and outside the hive and translating as well as reading the codes of the waggle dance, all processes that require integration of different navigational information. Several forms of memory have been found to guide navigation (recent reviews: [@pone.0091364-Gruter1], [@pone.0091364-Menzel1], [@pone.0091364-Menzel2], [@pone.0091364-Galizia1]). In particular, route flights between hive and feeder lead to a memory of the flight vector that are bound to the sun compass and can be communicated in the waggle dance. A more flexible memory about spatial relations of landmarks is formed during the exploratory orientations flights of bees leaving the hive for the first time. This latter form of memory allows bees to steer to learned locations e.g. the hive, a different feeding site, and a dance communicated site along novel short cutting routes.

Variation in anatomical structure is a result of several forces such as: the adaptation of species to the prevailing conditions in their habitats [@pone.0088199-NiklasK1], phenotypic plasticity as an ability of individuals with an identical genotype to develop differently - based on specific conditions during their ontogeny [@pone.0088199-Sultan1], [@pone.0088199-Pigliucci1], and evolutionary constraints (phylogenetic inertia) in which taxa that share part of their evolutionary history possess similar 'blue-prints' [@pone.0088199-Peat1]--[@pone.0088199-milauerov1].

The spread of pain and similarity of characteristic signs of different pain sources have made the diagnosis of the origin of pain difficult. The temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are common causes of pain in the maxillofacial region. Understanding the common signs and symptoms of this disorder is important ([@A24395R1]). The importance lies in mimicking the symptoms of TMD and other conditions. Pain due to styloid process (SP) fracture is similar to that of TMD ([@A24395R2]). The styloid process of temporal bone is a cylindrical projection on the inferior aspect of petrous bone. The stylo-hyoid ligament (SL) is a fibrous cord, which is attached from the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone to the end of the styloid process. The combination of these three anatomical structures is known as the stylo-hyoid chain (SC). The proximity of SC to important anatomical structures like the contents of the carotid sheet reveals the importance of SP and SL ([@A24395R3]).\n\nElongation of SP or ossification of SL is a characteristic sign of Eagle's syndrome and leads to pain of the neck or sore throat ([@A24395R4]).

Chemosensory cues provide valuable sources of public information regarding the identity and intensity of local predation threats ([@zoz050-B34]), allowing for context appropriate behavioral trade-offs. For example, wood mice *Apodemus sylvaticus* reduce foraging behavior when in the presence of predatory chemical cues ([@zoz050-B45]). Likewise, desert isopods *Hemilepistus reaumuri* use the presence vs. absence of the odor of scorpion *Scorpio palmatus* to make fine-scale risk assessments ([@zoz050-B51]).\n\nWithin aquatic systems, prey are widely known to assess predation risk directly from chemosensory information originating from the predator ([@zoz050-B34]) or through cues released by conspecific and/or heterospecific prey-guild members ([@zoz050-B48]; [@zoz050-B26]).

{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe ability to navigate is a challenging, high-order cognitive problem. Even in the simplest setting, such as in travel to a landmark in plain sight over open terrain (e.g., towards a church spire), navigating involves determining the required direction of travel and estimating how far to proceed. In reality, however, navigation is rarely this straightforward. Everyday experience typically requires navigation in multiple distinct contexts, varying in time course, familiarity and environmental complexity. For example, walking to work typically involves following a learned route to a known location, whereas walking to a new location for the first time involves mapping out an entirely new route to the goal. In addition to differences in the nature of the navigation required, differences in the properties of the surrounding environment and distance to be covered also exert a defining influence on the combination of cognitive processes involved in navigation (e.g., crossing a toy strewn nursery vs. driving to the airport).

The tendency for specialization and uniqueness is profound on the genomic level, as the existence of identical multiple copies of the same gene (unless they relate to mobile elements) is rare.

Such specificity can be achieved through a combinatorial effect of several regulatory mechanisms acting on different levels of gene expression -- from initiation of transcription to posttranslational modifications, where similar regulatory sequences occur in groups of functionally related genes.

However, during neuromuscular blockade, in the presence of beta-blockers, or in patients who only tolerate 'light levels' of anaesthesia, these clinical parameters may fail to reliably monitor the depth of anaesthesia. Despite the stability of these parameters, patients may become conscious during surgery, potentially leading to explicit memory of words spoken in the operating room, discomfort, or pain.

As a result, future dairy farming systems may become increasingly reliant on pasture instead of grain to feed cows. In this scenario, the selection of dairy cows that can produce at high levels with lower levels of feeding is important. As cattle reproduce slowly, we need to develop methods to select suitable cattle before the change in production systems occurs. Fortunately the range of production environments in which dairying is already carried out in Australia is wide, from fully pasture based systems to fully feedlot based systems, and from tropical climate to temperate climate [@pone.0006676-Hayes1]. This gives us a chance to discover loci or genetic markers that can be used to select cattle that are suitable for future farming systems.\n\nGenetic variation in the sensitivity of milk production of dairy cows to environment has been reported.

Critically, these individuals were significantly more impaired in their work performance and social relationships. It is likely that subsyndromal symptoms, particularly depression [@pone.0058176-Fagiolini1] and negative symptoms [@pone.0058176-Bowie1], contribute to these 'residual' functional deficits across the major psychiatric disorders.

In mice, hair follicle morphogenesis is completed around postnatal day (P) 14, at which time the follicle enters a phase called catagen. During catagen, extensive apoptosis in the lower two-thirds of the follicle results in its dramatic regression, leaving intact the stem cell-containing bulge region. The hair follicle then goes through a relative quiescent phase referred to as telogen. Following telogen, the stem cells become activated, likely in response to inductive signals from the dermal papilla, and the follicle enters the growth phase characterized by active keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation known as anagen.

More upright postures result in ground reaction forces passing closer to the joint centres, thereby reducing the externally applied moments and the mechanical loading on the supporting tissues. However, the geometric benefits of upright limbs would also apply to small animals, allowing them even lighter limbs for a given safety factor, or an improved safety factor for geometrically similar bones and muscles.

Although flowering is composed of a series of typically irreversible sequential events, reversion from floral to vegetative growth is frequently observed in nature. Reversions can be divided into two categories: inflorescence reversion, in which vegetative growth is resumed after or intercalated within inflorescence development, and flower reversion, in which vegetative growth is resumed in an individual flower [@pgen.1000818-Tooke1],[@pgen.1000818-Battey1]. Reversion, which can serve a function in the life history strategy (perenniality) or reproductive habit (pseudovivipary), is essential for the life cycle of some plant species [@pgen.1000818-Tooke1],[@pgen.1000818-Battey1].\n\nVivipary in flowering plants is defined as the precocious and continuous growth of the offspring while still attached to the parent plant [@pgen.1000818-Elmqvist1],[@pgen.1000818-Goebel1]. Vivipary can be divided into two distinct types: true vivipary and pseudovivipary [@pgen.1000818-Elmqvist1].

However, capuchin monkeys, apes, and corvids are the species that have produced the most impressive examples [@pone.0052074-McGrew1], [@pone.0052074-Hunt1]. Among those are cases of sequential tool use in which a tool is used to obtain another tool, which subsequently will serve to obtain an out-of-reach goal (e.g., food). Nonetheless, instances of sequential tool use among non-human animals are rather scarce. Bird & Emery [@pone.0052074-Bird1] have argued that the difficulty in sequential tool use stems from three problems: First, the subject must recognize that one tool can be used on another or on nonfood items. Second, the subject must resist the immediate motivation to use the tool to attempt to access the food directly, and third, the individual must be capable of hierarchically organized behavior.\n\nIn the laboratory, one of the most common tasks to test sequential tool use consists of presenting subjects with a reward that is out of reach, a readily available tool that is not long enough to reach for the reward but long enough to reach for another tool, which can be used to reach for the reward.

Electrical stimulation can be applied through the skin surface or via intramuscular electrodes to evoke contractions of the non-innervated muscles (Ferrarin and Pedotti, [@B9]).

Imaging flow cytometers based on wide-field CCD imagers ^[@R8]^ have similar throughput limitations to microscopes. To address these restrictions we have developed a multi-channel parallel microfluidic cytometer (PMC) that is based on analog detection combined with parallel microfluidics.

{"text": "1. Introduction {#sec0005}\n===============\n\nA large proportion of research targeting neurophysiology relies on *in vivo* animal experiments, utilizing a plethora of techniques such as electrophysiology, circuit tracing, and optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations. While conducting these experiments in a live organism is inevitable to study neuronal processes, preparatory steps can be conducted in alternative models. Broadly, two types of instances can be distinguished, i.e. (1) the training of entrance level scientists and (2) establishing a new *in vivo* experiment. Conducting stereotactic craniotomies, virus injections and implantations requires not only fine motoric skills but also knowledge of how to use the equipment (e.g. an intuition of the degrees of freedom of stereotactic arms) and how to handle delicate probes (e.g. electrophysiological electrodes). With our model, all of those procedures can be trained without an animal. Further, for setting up a new neurophysiological *in vivo* experiment, functionality and noise levels of the setup need to be tested, which includes both individual tools such as electrodes, fibers and recording devices, as well as aspects of the behavioral setup or arena used for recordings. Even if individual tools or procedures have been applied successfully in the lab, unanticipated complications can arise from a newly assembled"}

Not only is it distressing for the patient and parents, but the process involves a lot of time, and preparation, from the clinical team. In young infants, sedation is sometimes used to perform lumbar puncture in difficult cases. A delay in receiving microbiology results can impact clinical management, leading to empirical antibiotic treatment of infection and unnecessary, distressing repeat investigation. All microbiology specimens are sent to an off-site laboratory for analysis.

As illustrated by the examples of oxygen handling [@pgen.1000129-Suzuki1], energy control [@pgen.1000129-Spiegelman1], and ion homeostasis [@pgen.1000129-Hentze1], such accuracy frequently involves the precise coordination of multiple cellular pathways, and mechanisms for regulating and balancing opposing activities. In cancer networks, many similar requirements for pathway balance are likewise found as successful tumorigenesis requires the robust integration of both pro- and anti-oncogenic pathways controlling cellular proliferation, apoptosis, motility, adhesion and senescence [@pgen.1000129-Choi1],[@pgen.1000129-Nilsson1]. The importance of balancing opposing activities in cancer is illustrated by genes such as *HEF1* (*NEDD9*), a metastasis-related gene [@pgen.1000129-ONeillG1] and *HMMR*, a gene involved in centrosome formation (Pujana et al. 2007). Either repression or overexpression of *HEF1* can cause mitotic defects [@pgen.1000129-Pugacheva1],[@pgen.1000129-Dadke1], indicating that its activity in tumors requires tight regulation. Similarly, subtle alterations of *HMMR* expression in normal mammary tissues may promote breast tumorigenesis, underscoring the need to keep the *HMMR* gene tightly regulated [@pgen.1000129-Pujana1]. Such findings support the notion that balancing the activity of positive and negative effectors is likely to be a central requirement of many cancers.\n\nAt the systems-level, pathway balance"}

Following the pioneering studies by Arens ([@B3]) and Steemann Nielsen ([@B103]) on the use of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for photosynthesis of aquatic plants, numerous studies on the regulatory role of light and DIC for underwater photosynthesis of aquatic plants have been conducted. Particularly, the use of DIC by aquatic plants has fascinated researchers and been reviewed several times (e.g., Madsen and Sand-Jensen, [@B44]; Maberly and Madsen, [@B39]; Raven and Hurd, [@B73]) because this process is important for growth and survival and the uptake mechanisms are very different from those of terrestrial, amphibious, and floating leaved plants exposed to atmospheric air (definitions of these life forms and examples of species are in Sculthorpe ([@B93])). Since the physical conditions differ markedly between water and air, we have often been approached by researchers asking for practical advice, unavailable in the literature, before engaging in work with underwater photosynthesis. Thus, this review serves to offer the background and a practical guide for measurements of carbon fixation by plants when under water.\n\nMoreover, a growing"}

Although a strong association between microbial (including viral) infections and asthma in children from infancy to school age has been shown in studies ([@kwy053C4], [@kwy053C5]), the direction of causation is unclear and may be bidirectional ([@kwy053C3]).

Modern dance employs all the techniques of ballet; however, a modern dancer is not obliged to uncritically follow the classical rules of execution of these techniques.\n\nClassical style strongly emphasizes esthetics, precision, and height.

Direct gene sequencing in sporadic cases revealed 7 missense, 3 nonsense, and 1 splice site mutation. In the group with familial inheritance, all patients presented with missense mutations. Important differences were observed regarding clinical features. Overall, patients with sporadic mutations had a more severe phenotype than those with familial inheritance.

The identification of the cupin superfamily was originally based on the recognition that the wheat protein germin shared a nine amino acid sequence with another protein, spherulin, produced by the slime mold *Physarum polycephalun* during starvation [@pone.0074477-Dunwell3]. This sequence similarity was also observed in a number of seed storage proteins called germin-like proteins (GLPs). Knowledge of the three dimensional structures of these proteins led to the collective name \"cupin\" on the basis of their \u03b2-barrel shape (\"cupa\" means \"small barrel\" in Latin) [@pone.0074477-Dunwell4].

It has become evident that emotional speech processing is a highly complex endeavor mediated by a differentiated network of fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal cortices, the amygdala, and the basal ganglia (BG). Specifically, it has been proposed that emotional speech processing can be divided into several sub-processes after the first encounter with an emotionally marked stimulus (identification of emotional significance, detailed emotional perception of stimulus, conceptual evaluation; see e.g. [@pone.0017694-Schirmer1], [@pone.0017694-Wildgruber1]). However, while there is growing evidence on the brain structures involved in emotional speech processing, the temporal dynamics of specific sub-processes and their impact on specific brain structures are less clear.

{"text": "HER2-positive breast carcinomas have been shown to display an early peak of relapses in the first 4 years after surgery, especially in the node-positive subgroup. To explain this observation, growth factors released at the time of surgery were investigated. The level of growth factors of the EGF family, detected in postsurgical sera from breast carcinoma patients, was found to correlate with surgical invasiveness. Indeed, following radical mastectomy, higher levels of serum EGF-like factors were found than after conservative surgery. This implicates that the growth of tumors overexpressing HER2, activated by these growth factors, should be stimulated after invasive surgery. Two retrospective analyses of the HER2 status of primary tumors included in a randomized clinical trial addressing the issue of conservative versus invasive surgery and of radiotherapy were performed by immunohistochemistry using the standardized herceptest. Survival analysis according to surgery indicated no differences in HER2-negative cases but indicated a poorer survival for HER2-positive node-positive patients who had mastectomy in comparison with those who had conservative surgery. Furthermore, local relapses in patients who had conservative surgery without radiotherapy were found to be anticipated in the HER2-positive subset.

This 2.5-MDa compartmentalized protease contains \u223c33 distinctive subunits in two major subcomplexes, the 20S core particle and 19S regulatory particle (RP/PA700). The 26S\\'s central regulatory hub is its hexameric ATPase complex (Rpt1-6), located at the 19S base. The ATPase ring\\'s N terminus (containing a coiled-coil domain) is intimately integrated with subunits involved in scaffolding, ubiquitin chain binding and processing. Its C-terminal side associates with the 20S proteasome via its C-terminal HbYX motif, which induces 20S gate opening to promote substrate entry. This architecture places the ATPase ring in a position where it can accept protein substrates on its N-terminal side, then, in an ATP-dependent manner, translocate them through its central pore and into the 20S for their degradation[@b1][@b2][@b3][@b4].

It requires ingenious experimental set-ups that often compromise between the high sensitivity and rapid kinetics allowed by electrophysiological recordings (at the single-channel level, 1-10 molecules can be functionally monitored in a membrane area of, say, 1 mm^2^ on a millisecond timescale) and the usually low signal to noise ratio associated with optical or spectroscopic methods.

Can schools in low-income communities provide a pathway out of poverty, or are the constraints of poverty too great for schools to overcome? Such questions are at the heart of debates about the role of education in social mobility in the United States. Despite decades of research, however, we still lack clear answers.\n\nIn this article, I provide new evidence to inform these debates. It suggests that the lack of a clear answer to the question is explained in part by the substantial variation in the role of schooling in shaping educational opportunity across places. Early childhood conditions are more important in some places, educational opportunities during the elementary and middle school years more important in others.\n\nThe article also provides a demonstration of how administrative test score data can be used to construct high-resolution place- and age-based measures of educational outcomes, despite a number of major limitations of available administrative data. In particular, the standardized tests used in schools vary across place, grade, and year; the resulting scores are typically coarsened into a small number of ordinal categories whose definitions also vary across place, grade,"}

Lineages within a species that are presumably under various stages of speciation have been an integral part of this discussion. From a taxonomic perspective, the intraspecific category representing diverging lineages within a species is often the subspecies [@pone.0041058-Mulcahy1]. Patten and Unitt [@pone.0041058-Patten1] define subspecies as \"a collection of populations occupying a distinct breeding range and diagnosably distinct from other such populations\", a definition generally accepted in practice. Subspecies have traditionally been circumscribed based on discontinuities in the geographical distribution of phenotypic traits [@pone.0041058-Mayr1], which has sometimes resulted in highly subjective delimitations. It is common practice in taxonomic revisions for several closely related taxa to be lumped together as subspecies, or subspecies to be elevated to the level of species.

According to Fiorino ([@CR48]), there are at least three different rationales for undertaking public participation: substantive, normative and instrumental. The substantive argument states that considering lay assessment of risks often leads to better decisions than merely relying on experts' judgement. The normative rationale is based on the notion that the public is best qualified to decide on matters that lie in their own interest. Finally, the instrumental argument reasons that decisions that are taken in consent with laypeople are more likely to be legitimate and accepted. Other authors (i.e. Arnstein [@CR6]; Rowe and Frewer [@CR42]; EIPP [@CR15]) discern different levels of inclusion in public engagement practices: from information through consultation to participation.

Dispersal into a patch may increase local population sizes by mass or rescue effects, or augment diversity through immigration of new species [@pone.0019525-Holyoak1]. From the perspective of the community of origin, however, dispersal also causes a loss of individuals [@pone.0019525-Gundersen1], [@pone.0019525-Holt1], [@pone.0019525-Amarasekare1].

The discovery in the 1990s of increased morbidity \\[[@GFS385C1]\\] and mortality \\[[@GFS385C2], [@GFS385C3]\\] in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with fast low-molecular (e.g. glucose, creatinine and urea) peritoneal transport (FLMT, also called 'high transport') was thus counterintuitive. Several explanations are possible:FLMT leads to increased glucose absorption, reducing the transperitoneal osmotic gradient necessary for ultrafiltration. Patients thus become overhydrated, leading to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and inflammation. In patients in whom FLMT results in negative ultrafiltration, clearance will be paradoxically reduced, causing underdialysis.FLMT is associated with fast high-molecular (e.g. albumin, protein) transport (FHMT) \\[[@GFS385C4]--[@GFS385C9]\\], as assessed by albumin and/or protein clearance \\[[@GFS385C5], [@GFS385C10]\\] or by measuring the large pore transcapillary clearance (JvL) using the PD capacity (PDC) algorithm \\[[@GFS385C4], [@GFS385C7]\\] (*vide infra*).

During interphase, a typical eukaryotic cell has microtubules emanating from the centrosome located near the nucleus, which extend to the periphery of the cell, presumably interacting with the cortical actin filament meshwork. Microtubules during interphase are thought to be mainly required for the organization of the membrane systems (e.g., vesicular traffic and organelle movement). The actin-rich cortex is important for maintaining cell shape and for cellular movement.\n\nThere is increasing evidence of coordination between the actin and the microtubule cytoskeletons ([@B29]; [@B27]). Data from a number of systems suggests that many cell types use a combination of microtubule and actin filament--based transport in vesicle and organelle trafficking. It is well established that microtubules are required for long distance transport of cellular components. In contrast, the actin cytoskeleton is thought to be required for more local traffic. The best evidence for transport along both cytoskeletal systems is in neurons. Vesicles appear to be transported along actin filaments in mammalian growth cones ([@B14]).

It is therefore of interest to examine if and how phenotypic induction early in ontogeny affects later phenotypes. Such knowledge is important if we want to predict how changes in one environment affect phenotypes in another environment.

Large volume displacement oncoplastic surgery allows the surgeon the ability to resect large volumes of breast tissue and achieve the advantages in large volume resection which include fewer positive margins,^[@bibr2-1073274817729043],[@bibr3-1073274817729043]^ while maintaining and possibly improving the aesthetics of the breast form using mastopexy and breast reduction designs.

This genus was initially established for two species based primarily on the distinctive triangular shape of the head of females. Four species have been described to date: *Paranastatus egregius* Masi, 1917 and *Paranastatus violaceus* Masi, 1917 from Seychelles, and *Paranastatus verticalis* Eady, 1956 and *Paranastatus nigriscutellatus* Eady, 1956 from Fiji ([@B11], [@B3]). No new specimens of either *Paranastatus egregius* or *Paranastatus violaceus* have been reported since their original description and their biology remains unknown. However, [@B13] and [@B14] subsequently reared *Paranastatus nigriscutellatus* and *Paranastatus verticalis* from the eggs of the walking stick, *Graeffea crouanii* Le Guillou (Phasmatodea: Phasmatidae). Males are known only for *Paranastatus egregius*, *Paranastatus nigriscutellatus*, and *Paranastatus verticalis*. A key to these males was provided by [@B3].\n\nEupelmidae is likely a grade-level taxon ([@B4]) rather than being monophyletic ([@B8]), though Eupelminae is supported as monophyletic ([@B4]).

{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nAn enduring question in object recognition is what defines expert perceptual processes and how different they are from regular, everyday object recognition. This question was amply explored in the domain of face processing, a domain of natural expertise in all human adults. Faces form a highly homogenous set of stimuli with a very similar spatial configuration of parts. Therefore, discriminating between individual faces and extracting other relevant information from them should be, in theory, a difficult perceptual task. Nonetheless, humans are extremely adept in recognizing individual faces and categorizing faces along many other subordinate dimensions such as race or gender. This remarkable ability has been attributed by some to specifically tuned neural mechanisms distinguished by behavioral [@pone.0067024-Maurer1], electrophysiological [@pone.0067024-Bentin1], and neuroimaging [@pone.0067024-Kanwisher1]--[@pone.0067024-Puce1] markers. Others considered face perception as an extreme manifestation of perceptual expertise [@pone.0067024-Carey1]--[@pone.0067024-Tarr1], which may be generalized to objects other than faces, specifically to objects that form a visually homogenous category with a prototypical part configuration [@pone.0067024-Diamond1]--[@pone.0067024-Gauthier1]. The latter view challenges face specificity suggesting that processing characteristics usually attributed to faces are a general expression of expert visual processing rather than a peculiarity of face recognition.

Some of this damage escapes removal by DNA repair and is encountered by the DNA replication apparatus, which can block replication fork progression.

One major tolerance mechanism uses specialized DNA polymerases to incorporate a nucleotide opposite a damaged template base in a process called translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS permits continued replication, but may cause mutations. At least 7 of the 15 DNA polymerases in mammalian cells have a capacity for TLS ([@gks054-B1]).\n\nIt is important to understand the cellular function of each DNA polymerase.

Many different types of gene or gene product identifiers (IDs) are selectively used by these different databases and platforms. To leverage heterogeneous annotations across different bio-sources during data analysis, one of the immediate tasks is to convert users\\' IDs from one type to another as required by the individual source. For example, after an Affymetrix microarray experiment, one must typically translate Affymetrix IDs to gene names, GenBank accessions, RefSeq accessions, UniProt IDs, etc. for further analysis. While this is a time-consuming and tedious process, more importantly, an incomplete or inaccurate translation may easily result in the loss of key information during data analysis.\n\nNCBI's Entrez Gene \\[[@R01]\\] is a popular bioinformatics source for the translation of gene IDs from one type to another. In addition, several ID translation tools also offer this service in a high-throughput fashion \\[[@R02]-[@R06]\\] (supplementary file 1), based either on Entrez Gene or on the UniProt/PIR mapping databases \\[[@R07]\\]. The research goal of the DAVID Gene ID Conversion Tool (DICT), one of the components in the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources \\[[@R08],[@R09]\\], is to provide a more comprehensive"}
{"text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea in 2015 has drawn public attention and inspired political debate regarding the regulation of infectious disease control in Korea. The discussion of the appropriateness of the regulatory system must take into account the interpretation arguments of and the legislative concerns regarding the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act (hereafter, 'Infectious Disease Prevention Act'), its ordinance and enforcement regulations as well as public statements from the relevant administrative agency. The Infectious Disease Prevention Act of 2015 has been much improved through two successions of amendments; through the amendments, there has been great progress in the regulation of quarantine measures in infectious disease control. The initial amendments on July 6, 2015 give the government the legal authority to immediately and actively order medical institutions to follow property quarantine measures when the infectious disease enters the epidemic phase. Following the amendments in December 29, 2015, financial compensation for losses incurred due to property quarantine enforcement has been established for the high effectiveness of the authority of the measures.\n\nAccording to the current Infectious Disease Prevention Act, quarantine measures can be classified into five types of personal quarantine and two types of property"}

In his collection of notes from post-mortem observations of human anatomy and poorly understood pathology, da Vinci merged what were the distinct disciplines of art and science to describe and depict human development and physiology.[@CR1] Five-hundred years later, significant advances in technology enable non-invasive visualization of atherosclerosis using multiple imaging modalities, moving beyond anatomical characterization toward directly imaging disease processes and pathophysiology. The current challenge for imaging scientists lies in identifying high-risk atherosclerotic lesions that could lead to coronary or cerebrovascular sequelae prior to adverse vascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and thereby enable personalized therapy while mitigating risk.\n\nHerein, we present a general introduction to advanced non-invasive imaging of atherosclerosis with particular emphasis upon \\[^18^F\\]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). We will discuss the role of FDG PET for the identification of the high-risk \"vulnerable plaque\" across the arterial tree and its potential for monitoring disease progression and response to therapy.\n\nAtherosclerosis {#Sec2}\n---------------\n\nAtherosclerosis is the most common underlying pathology responsible for adverse"}
{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\nPreoperative assessment of the axillary nodal status in primary breast cancer using ultrasonagraphy is now established practice and mandated by the NHSBSP. However, the criteria for nodal biopsy are based on the morphological appearance of the imaged nodes. This study\\'s poster proposes that the tumour and grade stage of the primary tumour should also influence the threshold for nodal biopsy with the intention of improving preoperative assessment and thus decreasing morbidity associated with further surgical intervention to the axilla following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nA retrospective analysis of final nodal status of the 296 surgically treated patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer in 2011 was performed. Data including preoperative assessment of tumour size, grade, axillary node status (preoperative and postoperative) and final outcome was collected. Patients with negative preoperative axillary node status were compared with postoperative node status and the proportion requiring further treatment was ascertained.\n\nResults\n=======\n\nA total of 207 had negative axillary preoperative assessment and underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Fifty-one had positive sentinel lymph nodes, and of these 9% required further surgery. Sensitivity at the identification of positive axillary nodal disease preoperatively was 0.49 and specificity calculated at 0.99. Preoperative"}
{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nChromatin structure serves as a central regulator for DNA-associated cellular processes in eukaryotic cells, including transcription, replication, and repair. The primary components of chromatin are the highly conserved histone proteins, which provide the structural foundation for the organization of DNA. Molecular genetic, biochemical and genome wide studies have elucidated many aspects of the structural and functional roles of histones in genome organization. Here we investigate a set of nucleosome surface mutants in yeast with respect to their potential impact on chromatin structure, silencing and DNA repair.\n\nEukaryotic genomes are folded in arrays of nucleosome cores connected by linker DNA and further condensed into compact fibers and additional levels of higher order structures. While nucleosome cores are formed by intranucleosomal histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts, the close proximity of nucleosomes in arrays and higher order structures may require internucleosomal interactions of histones and DNA as well as a contribution of non-histone chromosomal proteins [@pone.0026210-Bassett1], [@pone.0026210-Li1]. Nucleosome cores are cylindrical particles containing of about 147 bp DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histones, two each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The histones are folded in the centre of the core and have flexible N-terminal tails that protrude from"}
{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nStudies on improvisation in music and motion have mostly focused on a single improviser [@pone.0087213-Brown1]--[@pone.0087213-Limb1]. When people improvise together, special phenomena can arise. Experienced musicians, actors and dancers that improvise together report special moments of high performance and synchrony [@pone.0087213-Berliner1]. These are moments of creativity that arise out of the interaction between people, seemingly without a leader and a follower. As musicians often describe it, 'The music played us'. These moments can be defined as moments of togetherness. This may relate to concepts such as 'being in the zone' in theatre and sports, described as \"a state of unselfconscious awareness in which every individual action seems to be the right one and the group works with apparently perfect synchronicity\" [@pone.0087213-Seham1]. In anthropology, togetherness relates to communitas [@pone.0087213-Turner1] and interpersonal synchrony in meaningful rituals [@pone.0087213-Konvalinka1], and in psychology it may relate to the concept of group flow [@pone.0087213-Csikszentmihalyi1], [@pone.0087213-Sawyer1] and dyadic states in parent-infant interaction [@pone.0087213-Fogel1].\n\nRecently, building on the growing field of joint action research [@pone.0087213-Sebanz1]--[@pone.0087213-Hari2], a paradigm to experimentally study togetherness was presented [@pone.0087213-Noy1]. This paradigm is based on the mirror game, a theatre exercise whose purpose is to help actors experience moments of togetherness [@pone.0087213-Schechner1],"}
{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe birth and death of neurons and the growth and retraction of their axonal and dendritic arbors are critical features that mediate adult plasticity of the vertebrate brain. These processes, accompanied by changes in the electrophysiological properties of neurons, permit the brain to adapt to both short term and long term environmental changes, allowing the organism to survive and successfully reproduce. One useful model system for investigating adult neural plasticity within the context of a behaviorally-relevant brain circuit is the seasonally breeding songbird.\n\nSeasonally breeding songbirds show dramatic plasticity in adult brain and behavior between the breeding and nonbreeding seasons [@pone.0035119-Brenowitz1]. In these species, photoperiod-induced changes in circulating levels of steroid sex hormones induce changes in the neural structure [@pone.0035119-Nottebohm1], neuron number [@pone.0035119-Nottebohm2], and electrophysiological properties [@pone.0035119-Meitzen1] of the brain regions that control behaviors related to reproduction. In songbirds, this includes song, a learned behavior used for defending territories and attracting females [@pone.0035119-Catchpole1], and the song control system, a network of discrete brain nuclei that control song learning and production [@pone.0035119-Zeigler1].\n\nSeasonal changes in song behavior and the song control system have been studied using largely morphometric and electrophysiological techniques. Little is known, however, about how breeding"}
{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nIn the sports injury aetiology and prevention research field, the use of the 'complex systems approach' has been recently promoted.[@R1] Inspired by previous work that questioned the routine application of reductionist scientific methodologies and statistical techniques,[@R2] Bittencourt and colleagues[@R1] argued for an alternative causal approach. This approach recognises that sports injury is a 'complex emergent phenomenon', resulting from the interactions among different factors (ie, a web of determinants), which may produce regularities (ie, a risk profile) that are antecedent to the emerging pattern (ie, sports injury). In brief, the theoretical assumptions underpinning the complex systems approach can be traced back to general systems theory,[@R5] which identifies several characteristics of complexity as a general philosophical precept. These include, but are not limited to, adaptation and learning, tight coupling, causal feedback, non-linear relations, sensitivity on initial conditions, threshold effects, stochasticity and historical dependency. Those characteristics have featured across multiple discussions in the sports injury scientific literature[@R1]; however, no study has yet applied a recognised method that has the capability to dynamically simulate and better understand complex systems causal patterns and processes. One computational modelling method that has been suggested as a suitable approach for sports injury research[@R1] is agent-based"}
{"text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe Mediterranean fish fauna is unique, characterized by a history of isolation and connectivity [@pone.0036443-Coll1] resulting from tectonic movements and changes in ocean circulation. Isolation of the Mediterranean is reflected in its rich marine flora and fauna, with an estimated total of 17,000 species [@pone.0036443-Coll1]. 619 fish species have been inventoried in the Mediterranean, among which 13% are endemic, 2% are introduced, and 67% are non-endemic natives. 85% of these fish are teleosts [@pone.0036443-Lasram1]. General geological and oceanographic processes such as those involved at the origin of the Mediterranean Sea have been shown to influence regional histories of fish diversity globally [@pone.0036443-Friedman1],[@pone.0036443-Hurley1]. Studying the Mediterranean region may therefore illustrate mechanisms contributing to diversification of teleosts and help us understand the current distribution of diversity in the region.\n\nDuring the Cretaceous (145--65 Mya), the Mediterranean was part of the Tethys Sea and was connected with the Atlantic as well as with the Indo-Pacific oceans. At this time, Africa, Europe and the Adriatic plates were coming closer together, making this ancestral Mediterranean Sea smaller and smaller, and drastically changing its shape and connectivity. By the Miocene (23--5 Mya), the Mediterranean Sea was isolated from the Indo-Pacific. Subsequently, circa 7--5"}
{"text": "It is well known that the nucleic acids (NAs) ingested from food are metabolized in the digestive tract by endonucleases, phosphodiesterases and nucleoside phosphorylase into oligonucleotides, nucleotides, and even free bases. Some of these metabolites can be absorbed by intestinal endothelial cells and are utilized for the salvage synthesis of NAs throughout the body, a process important for infant nutrition[@b1] and for individuals with metabolic abnormalities[@b2]. Recently, it has been reported that ingested microRNA can regulate mouse gene expression *in vivo*[@b3]. This aroused our interest in the study of NA metabolism. The digestion of NAs is thought to start in the intestine and to be mediated by endonucleases[@b2][@b4][@b5]. Most textbooks and research papers describe a process in which histones are separated from DNA by pepsin and the acidity of the cellular environment, but few reports mention the role of the stomach in DNA metabolism. We noticed that much of our understanding of NA metabolism comes from studies conducted more than 30 years ago. However, it is well known that gastric juice is acidic, with a pH as low as 1.5 in some cases, and that depurination of DNA occurs to some extent under such acidic conditions. It is surprising that"}
