{"text": "Located in the Annapurna region, the Upper Mustang Trek is one of the most popular and travelled trekking sites in Nepal. Upper Mustang Trek is located beyond the great Himalayan range in the western part of Nepal. Apart from exploring the Himalayas and the arid but beautiful landscapes, Upper Mustang Trek provides the trekkers with the opportunity to observe the ancient Buddhist and Tibetan culture, still prevalent in the region. The major attractions of the Upper Mustang Trek are undoubtedly the ancient monasteries, some of them very old, the artistic caves and the barren lands and the mountains that lie scattered in the region. The culture at Upper Mustang is a beautiful mixture of Tibetan and Buddhist traditions. In the past, it used to be an independent state with a separate King ruling the region. Lo-Manthang is still considered as the Kingdom of upper Mustang.\nThe existing culture of the people of the Upper Mustang region greatly resembles to the Tibetan cultures exercised by the Buddhists. Going to the upper Mustang as part of the trek is one of the great ways to experience the old charm of the Himalayan mountain deserts. Several old and new monasteries and ancient caves"}

With The Confessions of Edward Day, she revisits an old affection, echoing an established classic, in this case, The Picture of Dorian Gray, while trying her hand, for the first time, at a male first-person narrative.\n\nThe voice is of Edward Day, a young, handsome, ferociously ambitious actor on the make in 1970s New York. When he is in his freshman year, Edward\u2019s mother kills herself in what is hinted at as an enforced act of liebestod. A few years after this tragedy, Edward is saved from a drowning accident off the coast of Jersey by the sinister, tormented Guy Margate, who has the threatening qualities of resembling Edward physically and of sharing his ambition of making it as a theatre actor.

The two schools of thought take this idea to different conclusions; Austrian economics advocates for far less government in recessions, whereas MMT advocates for greater deficit spending in recessions.\n\nBasing my conclusions on the disastrous austerity contractions of the Bruning Chancellery, as well as contemporary Ireland and Greece, I have already railed quite strongly against the concept of austerity during a recession. Readers have (understandably) been quite sceptical. The position I am taking puts me in line with Professor Krugman, and various other Keynesian characters. And I agree that every dollar spent by the government must be taken out of the economy in taxation. And, government spending is often (but not always) plagued with problems such as regulatory capture, mismanagement and malinvestment.\n\nBut the evidence is clear \u2014 heavily indebted nations that slash spending and (as in the case of Greece today) raise taxes to \u201cpay down debt\u201d"}

The idea behind MSMTs is to provide spanning trees that minimize the costs of edge traversals in a Markovian manner, that is, in terms of the path starting with the root of the tree and ending at the vertex under consideration. In a second part, the chapter generalizes this class of spanning trees in order to allow for damped Markovian effects in the course of spanning. These two effects - that is, (i) the sensitivity to the contexts generated by consecutive edges and (ii) the decreasing impact of more antecedent (or \"weakly remembered\") vertices - are well-known in cognitive modeling (Gaerdenfors, 2000; Kintsch, 1998; Murphy, 2002; Sharkey and Sharkey, 1992}. In this sense, the chapter can also be read as an effort to introduce a graph-model to support the simulation of cognitive systems.

As a mentor among Chicago\u2019s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, his approach to composition and improvisation always demonstrates the permeable boundaries of Black music. SoundDance, a two-disc set of concert recordings released to celebrate his 80th birthday, shows once again the depth and breadth of his responses to a broad and constantly changing sonic environment.\n\nThe first disc pairs Abrams with the late tenor saxophonist Fred Anderson, a long-time friend of Abrams with whom precious few duo documents exist. This may be Anderson\u2019s last concert recording, and it is a powerful one. Their four-part suite, \u201cFocus through Time \u2026 Time,\u201d works as a connected whole and in microcosm. It encompasses the arch-like and fluid forms associated with a lot of freely improvised music, and yet there is significant back and forth that breeds worlds of detail. Introspective pauses abound and vie with passages of high energy, creating rhapsodic music that never loses its focus. When I saw Anderson at the 2008 Vision festival, his playing was being compared to late Coltrane, and it seems clear that Anderson\u2019s tightly wound"}

The tour opened last night to a sold-out house at the Hobby Center who gifted the accomplished cast with a rousing and radiant three-minute standing ovation. The original West End production of Les Miz continues its historic London run since 1985.

Here's the press release! The game was entirely made in Unity and Playmaker between a couple of friends.\n\nDescriptionRise 'n' Shine personifies hot air balloons as charming animal characters; and takes the player on an infinite runner styled adventure through the clouds. The gameplay introduces a challenging balance of collecting stars and powerups while optimizing fuel and dodging obstacles. Gameplay switches between calm and stormy skies to add even more variety, and as you fly higher, storms become more frequent and longer, while powerups and fuel become more rare. Stars can be collected throughout the game and used to unlock new balloon characters from a wide selection of cute designs, each with their own personalities. The game is rendered beautifully in a Disney inspired art style, full of rich colors and effects that pop. The animation and physics are fluid and really give the impression of soaring through the clouds. Although the game caters to kids, the game design and visuals may resonate with mature audiences and allure older age"}

Wilson stars opposite Ken Marino as a couple trying to get their relationship and engagement on track. As you'd hope, Marry Me has a few things in common with the dearly departed ABC series, and it's more than just Wilson's face.

Along the way he is accompanied by Edgar IV, the ship's British, sentient navigation system. The space ship can freely move around the screen while the background scenery scrolls vertically and many waves of enemies need to be defeated. There is a basic weapon with double cannons, different special weapons and an overdrive function. Between missions there are static cut-scenes showing the characters with voice-acting.\n\nInstead of a linear path, the game offers a map with sixteen levels that are mostly available right away, divided over two zones. There is a recommended path as a difficulty level is shown for each stage, but it is also possible to play them in any order. Generally there are two types of missions: ten side missions to earn upgrades and experience, and six story missions that end in a boss battle with the ability to assimilate the boss weapon afterwards.

Installed in the Plymouth Road Runner and Dodge Superbee, this engine easily propelled these B-Bodies to low 14 second quarter-mile times at trap speeds of more than 100 mph.

It began about 2500 B.C. and largely disappeared in the 1400's B.C. Historians once thought that the Minoan civilization ended after Crete was devastated by an earthquake, a tidal wave, and volcanic ash after a massive volcanic eruption on the island of Thera. This view is no longer held by most historians, who now speculate that Achaean invaders from the mainland may have destroyed the civilization.\n\nIn 1900, the British archeologist Arthur Evans unearthed the palace of the king at the ancient city of Knossos on Crete. Further discoveries on Crete and excavations on Thera beginning in 1967 revealed much about Minoan life and culture.\n\nFrescoes, pottery, and metalwork show that the chief deity of the Minoans was a mother-goddess.

{"text": "A surety is a party that provides a guarantee for another party. In the old days, a surety was an individual. This individual would provide their word on behalf of another and, if that other person did something improper, the first party would provide recompense to the party harmed. For example, in the old west, a shopkeeper would the surety for a rancher if they were getting a loan from the bank to purchase some cattle. If the rancher would then default, say by selling those cattle and gambling away the funds, the shopkeeper would pay the banker back all of the funds.\n\nThis evolved over time to the corporate arena. That is, it was more than just guaranteeing the \u201cJim\u201d did what he was supposed to do. Instead, the surety would be guaranteeing the performance of a company. Again, this could be a wealthy person guaranteeing that a company would finish a job timely.\n\nOver more time, this evolved again so that a company became the guaranteeing party, or surety. What would happen is that a large company would guarantee that a smaller company would perform the contract per its terms. For example, a general contractor would provide surety"}

In this article we will be discussing residual income and it\u2019s benefits as well as it\u2019s drawbacks.\n\nFirst, what exactly is residual income? Residual income is income you gain by doing something once and then receiving profits from it over and over again without your needing any further effort on your part. We are all accustomed to doing work once and then getting paid for the work we do. For instance, in a traditional job you work eight hours and get paid once for those eight hours. Residual income is like working eight hours, and instead of getting paid once, you get paid for those same eight hours again and again.\n\nResidual incomes can be and often are less per payment than earned incomes. Generally, the commissions earned on one time sales are often larger than commissions earned on sales of products that require renewals and maintenance. However, when looked at over a period"}

Here, she narrows the focus to her two-dimensional output. Her heavily impastoed narrative paintings, which possess the same physicality and rawness of her works in clay, warrant the attention.\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s title, \u201cHoof II,\u201d alludes to Schulnik\u2019s training as a dancer, as well as to the central role unicorns and centaurs occupy in the show. With their suggestive horns and erections, Schulnik\u2019s unicorns are decidedly male, though their eyes are depicted as vaginal forms, perhaps reflecting their carnal desire. Developed from a group of small gouaches made in 2015, her female centaurs are dubbed \u201ccentaurettes,\u201d a term likely borrowed from Disney\u2019s 1940 film Fantasia, a clear touchstone for Schulnik\u2019s subversive and darkly erotic vision.

It is soft yet strong enough to use in 6 different carries including three front ties, hip carry, back carry and a pregnancy support wrap. The design of the 4D fabric allows the Ergobaby Wrap to safely carry your baby on your back unlike regular stretch wraps.\n\nMy Chiropractic Opinion on the Ergobaby Wrap\n\nUsing the wrap techniques shown for the Ergobaby Wrap, it is very ergonomic for both baby and wearer. Baby is held in nice and close to the wearer, ensuring that there is no excess strain on the wearers shoulders and back.\n\nAlso baby is held in an ergonomic M-posture whereby their knees are higher than their hips and spine is held in a C-curve which is important for newborns and small babies under 6 months.\n\nNegatives\n\nQuite thick, so maybe warm to use in summer, but would be great in the cooler months.\n\nYou need a second person to assist you when using the back"}

While many ideas about masculinity have been challenged and undermined, too little effort has been invested (by men, first and foremost) in fostering healthy aspects of maleness and reimagining unhealthy ones. The contemporary understanding of gender has generated a great deal of angst and a host of questions for men and boys. It was, therefore, with a mixture of keen interest and mild trepidation that I attended the event Man Up: Understanding Masculinity on Sunday afternoon at Christ Church Cathedral. What would be said, and in what tone?\n\nAdrian Harewood of CBC Ottawa hosted the event and opened by speaking of a contemporary reckoning for negative aspects of masculinity via his own past admiration for Bill Cosby, then invited his guests to read from their respective books.

When every dollar spent has to equal a sale, it can be difficult to justify doing video marketing, or any \u201cBranding\u201d marketing efforts at all. However, there are many excellent reasons why start-ups should make video marketing one of their key tactics.\n\nTop Reasons Why Start-ups Should Do Video Marketing\n\nVideo can elevate perception of your brand.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges start-ups often face is seeming equal to more established competitors. Most people have no idea how much it costs to make a video and assume that it is expensive. Therefore, producing a well-made video makes it seem as though you have a large marketing budget and the sales to support it. Pair your video with one or two testimonials from big clients, and suddenly you seem much more established.\n\nVideo is not as expensive as you think.\n\nAlthough video seems expensive, it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be.

Many businesses are slowly learning how lucrative the market can be. According to MuslimVillage.com, this market is worth over $5 billion globally.\n\nRecently, however, no beauty product has much of a stir as Inglot's O2M nail polish.\n\nA background -- Nail polish is an oft disputed topic in many Muslim circles. Over the years, many scholars have been in consensus that prayer can't be performed while wearing nail polish, as the required ablution (or wudu) is not done properly of water does not reach every part of the body. Nail polish is seen to preclude this, as it does not allow water to get to the nails.\n\nThe issue has been contentious among many Muslim women. Some stopped wearing nail polish altogether. Many choose to wear it only during their menstrual period, when they aren't praying. Still, others continue to wear it, citing that they don't see it as a big deal.\n\nWhat's revolutionary about the Inglot nail polish isn't the polish itself, but rather, the dialogue that has"}

The SSU seems to have only one chip select output, but how can I handle the rest of chip selects when connecting the multiple slave?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe SSU is designed for a single slave device, and therefore cannot be connected with the multiple slave device. When connecting with the multiple slave, the CS signal for each slave should be generated in the external circuit. If this CS signal can be generated by satisfying with the standards of the slave to be connected, there is no problem in principle in regard to connect the multiple device. In this case, the user must decide the generating method of the CS signal considering the electrical characteristic of the SH family MCUs and the slave device."}

The problem is that of the limits of the Divided Line of Plato, it is the limit of contradiction, paradox and absurdity that we are obsessed with and so the possibility of supra-rationality is almost completely forgotten in our tradition, even though it is represented as a limit of the Divided Line in the Republic of Plato: Analogy of the divided line.\n\nThe divided line divides experience into doxa and ratio. One limit is para-dox and the other is the supra-rational. Paradox is mixture and confusion. Note the best example of a study of this is Godel Escher and Bach by Douglas Hofstadter. From Quantum Mechanics this is entanglement. What we don\u2019t have is a good example of the study of Supra-rationality in our tradition. Supra-rationality means that two opposite are true at the same time without interfering.

It began as a penny paper aimed at a mass audience, but as it developed, The Sun came to be directed especially to a serious, intellectual, and issue-oriented readership. Its growth was slow but solid, as Abell rejected the prevailing wisdom that a newspaper should be a mouthpiece for a political party and held instead to an independent political line.\n\nThrough much of its history, The Sun has excelled at coverage of national and international news, at the same time placing less emphasis on local news. The Sun compiled an outstanding record in covering the Mexican War of 1846\u201348, in one famous instance reporting the fall of Vera Cruz (1847) before official tidings of the event reached the U.S. government.

Game Informer and Ubisoft later confirmed that this was true with two shots of our hooded hero standing in front of a Colonial era American flag. Pretty cool eh? Still, this only brings more questions. What will the story be about? What new gameplay elements will be introduced now that the setting has changed to the New World? We don't know for sure, but we can certainly speculate.\n\nLet's start by looking at what our new hero is carrying on his body. The recently released Game Informer cover includes a perfect shot of both the front and back of our protagonist as he stands atop a snowy hill. He carries a small hand-axe in one hand and a single-shot flintlock pistol in his other. Strapped to his back is a second holster filled with another flintlock pistol. People used to carry dual flintlocks in order to fire two shots quickly by holding one gun in each hand.

If someone leaves a treatment program and doesn\u2019t continue to work on their sobriety, they could relapse.\n\nProcrastination is not just putting off things you need to do; it can be the act of putting less important things over the things you should be doing. For example, a student might put off working on a term paper and choose to play his guitar all evening. Not turning in a paper will have a harsher consequence than not practicing chords. The student could get a bad grade and possibly fail the class.

The region's capacity for generating power is lower than that of any other world region, and growth in that capacity has stagnated. The average price of power in Sub-Saharan Africa is double that of other developing regions, but supply is unreliable. Because new household connections in many countries are not keeping up with population growth, the electrification rate, already low, is actually declining.

{"text": "Taking Responsibility\n\nBy Robert D. Jansen, PhD\n\nFritz Perls, a gestalt psychotherapist, used to ask patients who complained of being chronically depressed to make a detailed list of exactly how they were keeping themselves that way. His idea was that human emotions normally change continually; so if someone experiences any emotional state for very long they must be really working to maintain it by suppressing the other emotions which would have happened naturally.\n\nOf course, his patients used to complain about having to do this exercise, but it was amazingly effective. Perls felt that we are usually more responsible for our predicaments than we realize; and by taking responsibility for the way we are rather than blaming it onto someone else we take the necessary first step toward improving ourselves. The utility that this conceptual reversal generates in this and other gestalt exercises is analogous, I believe, to the leverage that newtonian physics creates: Aristotle had conceived of physical objects as static, at rest, unless forced to move. Newton conceptually reversed this idea and conceived of objects as continuing to move unless restrained.\n\nA popular notion these days in chiropractic circles is that significant research has not happened because the"}

I had to write a relatively simple algorithm, because it needs to run on a microcontroller. Some further experimenting with the color palette, weighting factors and randomization, as well as adding Perlin noise, will hopefully result in a more realistic fire. I also plan to add a rotary encoder for regulating the \u2018fire\u2019.\n\nSoon after my start with Arduino, I bought an external 32KB EEPROM, just in case a future project would need more memory than the board\u2019s modest SRAM. But when I finally needed it for a sketch, I realized that the 300 KByte RAM of my 480\u00d7320 TFT display could be used for this purpose as well.\n\nI had used pixels as memory before in visualisations of IFS fractals, where I made each pixel keep track of the number of times it was \u2018hit\u2019 by the iteration process,"}

As recent Saginaw News reports showed, most of Saginaw is in the desert.\n\nTo some, food \"availability\" is merely an issue of bad decision-making. If residents want to eat right, there is nothing really stopping them except the personal choices they make. Choosing nachos instead of salads, for example.\n\nBut for those who live in the desert, it's easy to find those nachos waiting at the nearby convenience store. And that ever-present temptation makes it tougher on families making day-to-day decisions on proper nutrition.\n\nThe truth is, it's a difficult issue, and one with no easy way out. Some might argue that if people simply demanded healthier choices, more choices would become available \u2014 cheaper and closer to home.

{"text": "Sermon Library\n\nOur Second Reading comes from the Gospel of John, the fourth chapter, verses 39-42. We are reading these four verses at the end of a long story, the encounter between Jesus and a woman by a well in Samaria, so some words of introduction are needed. It is interesting to note that this encounter happens immediately after Jesus meets Nicodemus in John 3. In the case of Nicodemus we have a distinguished religious leader, a pillar of the community, who comes to see Jesus under the cover of darkness. He asks Jesus two questions but then the chapter quickly turns into a monologue by Jesus about God\u2019s intention to save the world and how that will come about.\n\nIn our text for today the one who encounters Jesus is almost the exact opposite of Nicodemus. Instead of being a named, upstanding, male, leader of the Jewish community who comes in the middle of the night, Jesus meets an unnamed, woman, a despised foreigner with an irregular marital history. And he meets her at noon \u2013 in the fullest light of day.\n\nYes, Jesus encounters this woman in the light, an important image in the Gospel of John, and"}

{"text": "I have approx 4-5 hours to spend in Fort Lauderdale before catching my flight home. Are there any public lockers at Port Everglades to store luggage, e.g. lockers similar to ones at train stations and the airport?\n\nNo, there are not. Once you claim your luggage and clear immigration/customs, you are deposited outside the terminal. Your best bet would be to take a taxi to one of the hotels on 17th Street (the Marriott would be my choice) and check your bags with the hotel and then go do what you want to do.\n\nThe taxi fare is minimal (about $5) and the bellman will gladly accept your luggage. Of course, you should tip generously for the favor.\n\nMost airlines will only let you check your luggage within 4 hours of your flight's departure making it difficult to head back into town. However, you could do it in Ft. Lauderdale as the airport is so close to everything."}

The conditions of the river and its access to shipping and goods, commodities and raw materials, all reverberate through the United States economy and the job prospects for states linked together by the river as it flows through the American heartland, past New Orleans and out to the world.\n\nThat is why a coalition of international trade organizations from 10 states along the river recently formed the World Trade Center Mississippi River Alliance.

Chef's Choice designed an Electric Asian Knife Sharpener that simplifies the task of refreshing and resharpening the edges on all Asian and double-beveled blades. With diamond abrasive wheels set to the proper angle for sharpening, blades can easily be sharpened with a few strokes. Unlike Western and European blades, Asian blades are set at a more severe angle along the edge. At 15 degrees a different sharpener entirely is needed to keep these blades at their best. The sharpener has two stages for severe sharpening and quick refreshing of blade edges. The diamond abrasive wheels provide a rough sharpen that gives the blade back its edge, while the micron abrasives finish it off with a fine sharpening. Suitable for santokus, debas, and sashimi blades, the Asian Knife Sharpener produces factory results every time. Welcome the international blades along with international cuisine to your kitchen, and don't worry about proper sharpening with the Chef's Choice Electric Asian Knife Sharpener.\n\nFounded with the goal of crafting the world\u2019s best knife sharpeners, EdgeCraft revolutionized home and restaurant knife care.

The new malware has been primarily found in Europe, and is being spread primarily via phishing campaigns, using emails spoofed to appear as though they\u2019re coming from official sources.\n\nOne example recently discovered by the research team appears to come from the Swiss Government, warning recipients that there were errors in their tax returns.

{"text": "Added to your basket\n\nProduct Images Carousel\n\nBeschrijving\n\nHyperactive Julien (Guillaume Canet) and shy Sophie (Marion Cotillard) are pre-teen misfits who forge a bond based on their mutual hardships--for Julien it's his mother's terminal illness, and for Sophie it's the ridicule she receives for being Polish. They devise a game in which the passing of a tin carousel between them signals the recipient to carry out an outrageous dare designed by the other, with the trouble they get into only serving to bring them closer together. Ten years later, Julien and Sophie are in college--and while they have both grown to be attractive and intelligent, their relationship is still only platonic and their disruptive game still continues at a fevered pace. Continuing into adulthood and forging separate lives, their dares become more hurtful to each other. It soon becomes apparent that the game has only served to prevent them from admitting their true feelings for each other. This dark and whimsical debut from director Yann Samuell shows the influence of Luc Besson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, sidestepping traditional French cinematic austerity in favor of splashy, big-budget visuals. In fact, the entrancing first act (in which Julien and Sophie are children) is"}

Rather than focusing on the labor itself, Lockhart instead documented the workers during their lunch break, emphasizing their social rituals over production as a means of humanizing the face of a disappearing working class. Yet despite the amount of research put into the project, the quasi-ethnographic \u201cLunch Break\u201d feels surprisingly sparse and detached from the individual stories of the workers.

{"text": "Andrade New is a new take on a classic type family by DSType.\nThis typeface was inspired in the typographic work of Manoel de Andrade de Figueiredo (b.1670-d.1735), Nova Escola para Aprender a Ler, Escrever e Contar, printed in 1722 at Offcina de Bernardo da Costa de Carvalho. This is one of the most important books, and almost forgotten, about Portuguese calligraphy, and the work of Andrade de Figueiredo is among the most amazing examples of calligraphy of the Eighteenth Century. His work inspired Ventura da Silva, a Portuguese calligrapher, who in 1803 published a book named Regras Methodicas, where he redesigns some of Figueiredo\u2019s specimens. But Ventura\u2019s purpose was to create a more elegant and readable typeface than Didot and Bodoni. This kind of typeface used to be called leitura and is a transition between the baroque and modern typography. Andrade is a brilliant text typeface and is available in Regular, Italic, Bold, Swashes and Script. Andrade is DSType\u2019s tribute to Portuguese calligraphy and to the work of Manoel de Andrade de Figueiredo."}

The technology not only aids in reducing the size of the electronics but also improves functionality by increasing performance, processing speed, and memory storage. It can be noted that nanomaterials play a key role in the development of atomic electronics. Also, with the evolution of smartphones, wearables, flexible electronics, and Internet-of-Things (IoT), members of the consumer electronics value chain can adapt atomic electronics, thereby developing advanced electronic products.\n\nThe technology and innovation report highlights key technologies enabling development of atomic electronic devices. The report offers insights on the technology, stakeholders, and key industry initiatives. It also assesses technology cycle and the global development and adoption footprint.

{"text": "Excess Land Application of Dairy Manure Constitutes Open Dumping As Solid Waste\n\nLast month, a federal district court held a Washington dairy liable under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") because the court determined that the CAFO land applied manure at high rates without regard to actual crop fertilization needs, presumably in an effort to discard excess supply. Land application of agricultural wastes as fertilizer is relatively commonplace and is specifically excluded from RCRA's reach when done for that purpose. However, the court found that the CAFO over-applied manure on its fields to the extent that the application could not be classified as a fertilizer; instead, it constituted open dumping of a solid waste and caused an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment. The defendant, Cow Palace LLC, is a concentrated animal feeding operation (\"CAFO\") that generates on the order of 100 million gallons of manure each year and land applies much of that manure as fertilizer over 533 acres of its property.\n\nThe outcome of the case hinged on whether the CAFO handled the manure in a manner that eliminated its usefulness as a fertilizer. Applying that standard, the court ultimately found that the"}

Led by Lieutenant Colonel Tejero, they took the parliamentarians hostage under gunpoint. Their aim was to remove the current prime minister, Adolfo Su\u00e1rez, and largely reverse the transition to democracy that Su\u00e1rez had overseen since Franco\u2019s death. By default, Spanish television recorded this attempted, but ultimately failed, coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, making it possibly the only coup ever captured on TV. In his gripping The Anatomy of a Moment, Javier Cercas structures his portrayal of the Spanish transition to democracy based on these clips.\n\nAt first glance, the clips (which you can find on YouTube) seem to show that all the parliamentarians hid under their chairs once Tejero and his accomplices opened fire.

The three notable exceptions were the current prime minister, Su\u00e1rez, his deputy and chief of staff of the Spanish army, Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Mellado, and the party leader of the recently legalized Communist party, Santiago Carrillo.

What I've learned about myself is that I don't eat very much when I'm depressed, and I do eat junk food when I'm stressed or feeling inadequate. Why junk food and not fruit, vegetables and nuts??? Because junk food = comfort food. Comfort food makes you feel good because it tastes good and is familiar. The problem with eating junk food to ease stress is that it's not good for you, adds unnecessary fat, calories, sugar and salt to your diet and promotes weight gain. Both situations (not eating and eating junk food) shine light on unhealthy coping skills.Since 2014 started my stress levels have been through the roof! I think I bit off more than I can chew.

However, it seems Rae Sremmurd, and/or his record label, aren\u2019t too keen on the song being spread across the internet meme-style.\n\nWhen uploading videos to social media to join in on a viral craze or share a holiday-themed video with a smooth Michael Bubl\u00e9 Christmas track, it\u2019s important to remember basic copyright laws for music (referred to more formally as \u201csound recordings\u201d).

Trains on Planet Tal were developed by agudner engineers after the war, with the main railway system going from Shigu all the way to Reono. They were mainly used for material transportation from Reono to Shigu and back. Afterwards, more trains and railways were developed for people within the Shigu lands mainly for personal transport.\nIn Gold Ring, there are tramways that connect each town or district.

Before PPR, redraw of individual page elements was only available through custom Javascript code, which is generally discouraged in BLAF applications because of cross-browser incompatibility and reliability.\n\nPPR offers significant benefits to users. When implemented correctly, PPR both improves application performance and provides more direct feedback when users perform actions. This guideline includes the following sections:\n\nInteraction and Usage Specifications\n\nPPR is intended only for partial rendering of pages that do not require extensive back-end processing. Do not use PPR when most of a page's content needs to be redrawn, or time-consuming queries are needed to generate/refresh the content.\n\nUnlike full page reloads, PPR does not force focus to the top of the page, and thus provides a minimum of distraction from the task at hand.\n\nWith PPR, the \"Go\" button can be omitted from choice lists and radio groups in many contexts.

The former tannery business, closed for about 30 years, was destroyed by fire in 1995. The 27 acres along U.S. Route 422 are owned by Leatherworks Partnership, a group of three investors. Anthony Cervone III, operational services manager for Innerscope Technical Services, Austintown, said Wednesday the cleanup will resume Monday. Cervone said the effort to remove debris will concentrate on an area where the main building was located. Although the property owners want the work to be done by the end of the month, Cervone said it will probably take longer. During a three-day cleanup effort at the end of August by Terreri &amp; amp; Sons of North Jackson, a large 10,000- to 20,000-gallon underground tank was discovered.

{"text": "\u20ac 84,23\n\nThe book offers a comparative analysis of the recent changes in ideology and party programmes on economic policy of the British Labour Party and the German SPD (S0zialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). Using a historical institutional approach, Knut Roder focuses on labour market policies and explains the process of policy change. The book offers a unique combination of quantitative party policy content analysis with qualitative data and numerous interviews conducted for this book with the parties' policy makers. It reveals the Labour Party's and the SPD's search for an alternative approach to economic policy during their long spell in opposition in the 1980s and 1990s, and illuminates how both parties arrived at the current 'third way' / 'Neue Mitte' rhetoric. Their search for new policies was highly problematic, and led eventually to a 'delayed', incremental adoption of neo-liberal inspired economic policies. There was a fundamental paradigm shift in the 1980s from Keynesianism to neo-liberalism, and the parties' slowness to adjust to this shift, Roder argues, was largely responsible for their electoral failure. Similarly, their eventual adjustment to the new paradigm explains their electoral success in the 1990s. Applying the historical institutional analysis, this book argues that both parties' policy choices"}

{"text": "Inside Out.\n\nThis essay explores the need for higher education institutions to broaden their conceptions of the talent and experience required of those who assume managerial responsibilities. Colleges and universities are clinging to a parochial set of notions about the job descriptions and skills needed by those who would manage the enterprise of higher education. In the age of markets, accountability, and cost constraints, the motivations and skills of professionals inside the academy differ very little from those in outside settings. Without a real departure from the current practice in higher education, a real gap is likely to develop between the level of managerial skill required in the future and what will actually be available. Higher education, like nearly every other U.S. enterprise, is being recast by an accelerating shift from a producer-driven to a consumer-driven economy. A well-managed institution must focus on service, efficiency, and quality, and it must employ effective managers at every level. Colleges and universities tend to see themselves as entities that differ fundamentally from other organizations, but the reality is that the managerial skills required are very similar to those of other organizations. Institutions of higher education are often ignoring qualified managers because they are"}

{"text": "Button mashing is a technique of playing video games. Most button mashers are inexperienced newbies who don\u2019t know how a fighting engine, or the timing, for some fighting game works. This technique is usually quite easy to beat as long as you have the jist of how to play that particular game. However, there are some games that button mashing will actually help intermediate and semi-advanced players, such as trying to find super KO combos in Marvel vs. Capcom. Sometimes, two or more buttons must be pressed at one time, so button mashing can produce fruitful results.\n\nIn addition to the multiple joystick rotation, button mashing will wear down controllers and arcade machines faster than if they were used in their normal fashion. So please be kind to the equipment that brings us joy and laughter, and keep the button mashing to a minimum. Know your game and victory will be ripe for the picking."}

{"text": "Intercellular communication in plant development and disease\n\nABOUT THE WORKSHOP\n\nPlants are sessile organisms that need to respond to changing environments during development. As a result they have evolved unique signalling mechanisms through plasmodesmata that allow rapid communication between different parts of the plant. Communication through plasmodesmata involves the trafficking of informational macromolecules such as transcription factors, gene transcripts, and small RNAs. Moreover, viral pathogens exploit these cell wall channels for intercellular and systemic spread, which often results in serious crop diseases. The EMBO workshop will bring together scientists working on plasmodesmata structure and regulation, plant development, defense signaling, gene silencing, and virus movement.\n\nThe aim of this EMBO Workshop is to support the development of new scientific concepts and experimental approaches for exploring the mechanisms, control and role of intercellular communication in developmental plant biology and crop diseases. Participants and speakers are expected to stay for the whole duration of the meeting. Young researchers and students will have excellent opportunities to participate in this meeting through presenting posters, short presentations, and through discussions during breaks and social activities.\n\nThe EMBO Workshop will be organized into the following sessions:\n\nStructure and Regulation of Plasmodesmata\n\nPlasmodesmata and Plant Development\n\nIntercellular Transport"}

If you are looking for Herald Square hair color correction, we here at Fabi\u2019s Hair Studio can provide you with organic coloring and expert styling that can help you achieve the perfect look.\n\nHair color can be tricky, especially when it comes from a box. Certain chemicals can severely damage hair and tackling something like hair color on your own can be challenging and sometimes dangerous. Hair can easily become damaged, or colors can come out completely different than expected. Not every boxed product will produce the same effect, especially on different hair types, colors, and people who may have color buildup or already damaged hair. When it comes to expert styling and coloring, it is always best to see a professional. Here at Fabi\u2019s"}

It\u2019s all silly fun, ably reflected by Butenko\u2019s wonderfully off-beat poster.\n\nButenko, a celebrated artist and author in his native Poland, eschews the famous image of Welch in that bikini and instead created a cartoon dinosaur gobbling down a hapless cavemen. It\u2019s simple, sweet and bold. The white of the caveman contrasts nicely with the green of the dinosaur and the solid blue background, while the orange text of the film tile pops out nicely.

Our habeas corpus clause is entirely un-English because it restrains the legislative power as well as all other power, and it is thoroughly American because it is conservative of personal freedom and also of the public safety in the day of danger.\n\nThere is still another particular in which we must guard against analogy. The motive of the English people in putting the habeas corpus power entirely within the control of Parliament was their jealousy of the Crown. Before the time of Charles II., the King had often atrociously abused the power of arrest and acted in utter disregard of the privilege of habeas corpus. It was the dread of such behavior of their monarchs, who at that time still retained a great deal of their arbitrary power, which aroused the English people to pass the great habeas corpus act. But the framers of our constitution had no such fears of the President. The powers of his office had been substantially settled before the habeas corpus clause was proposed, and there was nothing"}

When you make a purchase with a credit or debit card, a card authorization request is sent to the issuer to verify that the card is valid. Here\u2019s how.\n\nCredit card authorization is an approval that the customer has sufficient funds on their card to pay for the transaction. This is the approval from an issuer, usually through a credit card processor. If the customer details are correct and there are enough funds in their account, the specified amount is held and then deducted from customer\u2019s credit limit.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into the process.\n\nWhenever a transaction is made with a credit or debit card, the merchant sends a request to the acquirer, usually through a credit card processor, such as SecurionPay. Then, the acquirer submits a request to the issuer (What is an issuing bank?) to review the customer\u2019s account, check if the customer\u2019s card is valid and whether they have the required funds to complete the transaction.\n\nIf there are enough funds to cover the cost of the sale, the authorization hold"}

It actually makes an attempt at telling a good dramatic murder story, unfortunately it falls short due to its dreadful dialogue and laughable climactic scenes\u2026 until the very end when the twist hits you like a ton of bricks. You never see it coming.\n\nTo be brief, the story, based on the 2003 Korean motion picture called \u201cJanghwa, Hongryeon \u201c, is about a family who lost their matriarch in an action-movie-like explosion only to have their youngest daughter (Emily Browning) be committed to an asylum due to the mental and emotional scars of the occurrence. After a period of time, our young protagonist returns home to learn that her father (David Strathairn) has moved on with his life and intends to marry his dead wife\u2019s nurse (Elizabeth Banks). Bad blood brews between the two females and the journey to unmask the true objective of the nurse begins.\n\nThe pacing of this film is rather slow, mixed in with average acting and a banal dialogue that only exists to move the story along. The films true virtue lies in its ending and it really is the only worthy element of \u2018The Uninvited\u2019."}

They'd be better off putting forth a message like, We might have our own ways, but we also make a contribution."}

The service is intended as a non-exclusive way to quickly shuttle music, photos, and videos between the various devices in LG\"s ecosystem, including PCs, smartphones, and TVs.

Interestingly, the lines between where the dilapidated portions of the neighborhood and neatly cut grass and well kept buildings seemed to blur together a bit. I have remember seeing a rather nice looking church, a cemetery, and some sort of government building nearby all in great, if not exceptional condition.\nThe restaurant itself was small-more parking lot than shop-with a faded pig greeting passerby on its dimly lit sign.

He was a loner who craved acceptance, and he lifted much of his music from black entertainers. Still, by the time his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, found him, Elvis Presley was on the way. But because he was not very bright, he was putty in the Colonel's manipulative hands. This big biography by Goldman\u2014author of Ladies and Gentlemen\u2014Lenny Bruce!!\u2014is based on interviews with many Presley intimates, though Parker himself did not cooperate. It is lively despite its bulk (598 pages) and certainly the best of the books about Presley that have been published since his death. The entertainer's dark side is revealed\u2014his odd sexual preferences, the bizarre formal courtship of Priscilla, unsavory hangers-on, profligate spending of millions, violence and his terrible last years as a drug-ridden, bloated hulk.

By the time Diarmuid Connolly scored after five minutes, everyone in the stadium knew what we were in for.\n\nI know the GAA considered making the hurling the main event this week, but surely what unfolded is the perfect excuse for making this move in the future.\n\nMuch like it's unfair that Dublin play all their football games in Croke Park for money reasons, it's also wrong for the GAA to put hurling in the ha'penny place to a lesser contest because the footballers pay the bills.\n\nWe should have had a Dublin display that put the country on notice, before a genuine contest between two All-Ireland contenders.

Truth became thus relative to a group of people and individuals (relativism). Based upon the relativist view, as a Sophist he taught rhetorical skills to win arguments, thereby reducing philosophy from a quest for truth to mere skills of argumentation and persuasion. The shift of the locus of truth from the sphere of existence to language parallels an orientation of postmodernism. Both Socrates and Plato challenged his philosophy, and Plato named one of his dialogues after him.\n\nLife and works\n\nProtagoras taught for nearly 40 years traveling Athens and surrounding cities, teaching the art of rhetoric and his philosophy to mostly wealthy Greek citizens. By the request of his friend Pericles, he drafted the laws of a new Greek colony Thurii. Protagoras wrote at least two books, Truth (or Refutatory Arguments or On Being) and On the Gods. His agnostic view of the gods presented in the latter caused his conviction on impiety and forced him to flee Athens, and"}

Natural hazards and catastrophes can be defined as processes, originating in the biosphere, with damaging fall-outs on mankind and the world we live in. The main hazardous catastrophes (varying in magnitude, frequency, duration, extent, onset speed, spatial dispersion and temporal spacing) are: earthquakes, volcano eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, coastal erosions, floods, hurricanes, drought, wild and man-induced fires, etc. It is worth noting that, in absolute terms, the economic costs of disasters have been increasing over the last decades. Furthermore, losses due to earthquakes constitute a significant part of the global losses due to natural hazards, and are those that yearly cause the highest number of casualties. In Europe (EU-27), more than 41 million people (about 8%) live in high seismicity regions; another 64 million (about 13%) live in moderate seismic areas. The total economic loss due to earthquakes during the 20th century is about 40 billion Euro alone in Europe.

Beginning with 2003\u2019s Pattern Recognition and continuing with Spook Country in 2007, Gibson has evolved a sort of fictionalized underground journalism. The loosely connected novels are tech-infused meditations on the undercurrents of art, fashion, conspiracy theory, and commercial detritus that surface briefly on some blog or obscure news site before being replaced by the next distraction. Some of these are trivial; some have deeper implications. With Zero History, he once again takes his readers on a tour of this modern subviral landscape.\n\nAlthough not strictly a sequel, the book draws on the two prior novels. Hubertus Bigend is CEO of a European marketing firm with tendrils stretching into every aspect of global commerce. Enigmatic and"}

The more wealthy you are in the United States, the more likely that you will eat nutrient dense food. Poor nutrient quality food, excessive sugars and overly processed fats are omnipresent in the diet of low-income Americans. That is not to say that every person of meager means is eating a crappy diet of cola and fast food hamburgers. So no need to write me any letters scathing me for being elitist.

I was intrigued by the premise, but given who the main characters were (a wounded male rocker and a female FBI agent), I figured a romance was going to be central, and many stories that center around romances don't work for me. Well, the romance wasn't really central, and it was handled very naturally. The book as a whole was more than just a good read. It blew me away.\n\nI did have a few small quibbles, so let me get those out of the way now. One or two things were set up but never referred to again. For instance, near the beginning Dante is summoned to appear before another New Orleans vampire, but that vampire never resurfaces.

When information is well designed (in both literary and visual terms), it brings the information you are presenting to a whole new level.
