{"text": "Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment in Gynecology\n\nHereditary cancer risk assessment should be part of routine obstetrics and gynecology practice. Over the last decade there has been an increased awareness of hereditary predisposition to a wide range of diseases including cancer, heart diseases, and diabetes. These are all complex multi-gene disorders, but the identification of specific genes associated with a predisposition to these conditions has allowed clinicians to more accurately assess risk and prescribe preventive interventions. Though it may be unfamiliar to many practitioners, the process of cancer risk stratification can be efficient and effective. Using protocol-driven evaluation of cancer susceptibility, personal and family risk factors, and genetic testing, it is possible to create risk profiles and management strategies that demonstrate proven reduction in cancer morbidity and mortality. Decades before genetic testing entered practice, clinicians had an undue burden of breast and ovarian cancer, often featuring early-onset cases and male breast cancer. In the mid-1990s linkage analysis in these breast and ovarian cancer families enabled the identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2, genes that normally function in DNA repair. Cancer genetic counselors use pedigree analysis and clinical indicators to assess the probability that a patient carries a heritable mutation, to determine appropriated"}

The core book already recommends sending characters on quests to achieve special abilities. Making this necessary to advance is not only an annoying penalty for the class, but it also makes such characters steal the spotlight from the others.\n\nThus I'll only use the iconic abilities for paladins, rangers and antipaladins - if you want something else, talk to your Judge. Antipaladin? Yes, I think the latter is different enough to deserve a class of it's own. My only problem is that I don't like the \"antipaladin\" name. How should I call a champion of chaos?

Seven days ago, the number took a huge drop to 339,000, but was immediately followed by speculation that something was amiss. Business Insider blamed California\u2014who was not amused\u2014but the Bureau of Labor Statistics never did give anyone a straight answer about why the numbers were so far off expectations. Fast forward to this morning and the number missed expectations again, but this time in the opposite direction, coming in about 20,000 claims higher than predictions. So economists are wondering if that's just making up for last week's inaccuracy, if it's signals a real jump in the number of unemployed (and real trouble in the economy), or if these reports are just too wild to put any real faith into them. It's highly possible that all of those things are true.\n\nIf we didn't have an election coming up in less than a month,"}

{"text": "Tag: menopause sexuality\n\nIn the absence of an acceptable partner, masturbation is a reasonable and appropriate source of sexual enjoyment as well as a method of releasing sexual tension. At midlife and thereafter, women may choose this form of sexual release as the shortage of available men gives way to the general shortage of men in an aging population. Masturbation may also be the sexual outlet of choice, over and above available partners. Masturbation is also a good way of getting started for women who, because of estrogen depletion, experience arousal too slowly to begin sexual activity at the same time as a mate. It is also a loving way to express sexuality for men or women during the illness of either partner or in instances when the desired amount of sexual activity differs for each partner.\n\nThere is no right and no wrong when it comes to sex. Society\u2019s very recent acceptance of individual sexual preferences has also lifted the taboo on masturbation. Just as children need to be assured that there is nothing wrong with masturbation, so older persons need to know that it is not an improper activity for them.

{"text": "Abstract [en]\n\nInclusive and differential fiducial cross sections of Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions are measured in the H -> Z Z* -> 4l decay channel. The proton-proton collision data were produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb(-1). The inclusive fiducial cross section in the H -> Z Z* -> 4l decay channel is measured to be 3.62 +/- 0.50 (stat) (+0.25)(-0.20) (sys) fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 2.91 +/- 0.13 fb. The cross section is also extrapolated to the total phase space including all Standard Model Higgs boson decays. Several differential fiducial cross sections are measured for observables sensitive to the Higgs boson production and decay, including kinematic distributions of jets produced in association with the Higgs boson. Good agreement is found between data and Standard Model predictions. The results are used to put constraints on anomalous Higgs boson interactions with Standard Model particles, using the pseudo-observable extension to the kappa-framework."}

{"text": "How Hybrid Cannabis Came to be in the US\n\nAllegedly, in the 80\u2019s US soldiers were deployed to Afghanistan for the Soviet-Afghan conflict. As soldiers were arriving in Afghanistan, they noticed cannabis growing on mountain sides, looking like bushes rather than trees, at roughly 2-3 feet tall. These soldiers started smuggling plant seeds back to the US to grow themselves. Seeds were shared with friends and family that also cultivated cannabis. This new plant species was not only much shorter than existing cannabis, it only took 2 months to flower, rather than 4 months. What followed was the cross breeding of the two species.\n\nThis created the new craze: Hybrid Cannabis.\n\nCannabis Sativa is a tropical plant that originated close to the equator. Sativa plants are a taller species that can stand up to 12ft tall in nature and has airy buds with thin leaves. The leaves and bud structure alleviate heat so the plant can withstand great temperatures, and survive the humidity. Effects are often cerebral, uplifting and sometimes, giggly. Often, they carry a tropical or fruity aroma.\n\nThen we have the Indica plant which is a stocky and thick bush that hails from the windy mountain side. Indica"}

It is the reiteration of the previous documents, most notably the military doctrine of 2014 and most importantly, it is the reiteration of contemporary thinking of the Russian leadership and security establishment about Russia's place in the world and the threats, real and imaginary, current and potential, that, in their minds, Russia is facing. How much of this is a sober assessment and how much is a political paranoia? The exact ratio is hard to determine, but it definitely is a mix. It might be useful to separate the unhealthy and excessive suspicions, which is a burdening baggage from the times past and long gone (we all might have certain nostalgic troubles parting with our old baggage) from reality.

As a young teenager I loved his short stories like \u201cI, Robot\u201d and \u201cThe Bicentennial man\u201d but when I tried to read the Foundation Trilogy, I foundered. Too abstract, too complicated. I picked up Foundation again a few years ago as an adult, and I again lost interest. The problem, I realized, might have to do with how he wrote it, as a series of short stories that spanned thousands of years, and which therefore lacked a protagonist or organizing narrative to propel the action.

Starting January 1, the government will transfer 29 sorts of benefits (like pensions, scholarships, fuel subsidies) through the CTS, taking advantage of the Aadhar scheme for electronic identification of all individuals. In due course the scheme will be expanded to cover 42 benefits, and will cover the whole country by 2014, in time for the next election.\n\nRight now, says finance minister P Chidambaram, it costs the government Rs 3 to transfer one rupee to the pockets of beneficiaries. The rest goes on administrative expenses, waste and corruption. Cash transfers can eliminate intermediaries of all sorts, greatly reducing corruption and administrative burdens.\n\nRight now, beneficiaries have to produce different paperwork for every benefit.

{"text": "A phonograph, in its later forms also called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or since the 1940s called a record player, is a device for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound. The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc, called a \"record\". To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. In early acoustic phonographs, the stylus vibrated a diaphragm which produced sound waves which were coupled to the open air through a flaring horn, or directly to the listener's ears through stethoscope-type earphones.\n\nThe phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison.[1][2][3][4]Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone, including the use of wax-coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zigzag groove around the record. In the 1890s, Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove"}

In 2017, 2,073 incidents of hate crimes were reported, the highest number recorded since 2009 when Stats Canada started collecting this data. That is an increase of 47 per cent compared to numbers reported in the previous year.

But as the party approaches, his mother, nearly one hundred, dies herself, leading to a farewell doubleheader.\n\nAcross one bittersweet weekend in their San Diego neighborhood, the revelers mingle among the palm trees and cacti, celebrating the lives of Big Angel and his mother, and recounting the many tales that have passed into family lore, the acts both ordinary and heroic that brought them to a fraught and sublime country and allowed them to flourish in the land they have come to call home. The story of the De La Cruzes is the American story. This indelible portrait of a complex family reminds us of what it means to be the first generation and to live two lives across one border.

All the problems some of you were noticing on the Rev 2 ISO (localization bugs, DVDPlayer.app, couple of missing dependencies) were related with the fact that this ISO was based on a 10.5.4 disc, with a integrated (no so well as it seems) 10.5.6 combo update on it, and on top of that some of you were installing old language pkgs which I think are not fully compatible.

The experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats. On day 3 of postnatal life, a lasting and selective chemical damage of the central dopamine system was induced in the rats by infusion of 6-OHDA HBr (133.4 microg intracerebroventricular, base form) given bilaterally into lateral ventricles of the brain. Control animals received similar treatments injecting only vehicle. At 2 months of age, both 6-OHDA treated and control rats were randomly divided into two groups. Rats from the first group were exposed to 10 Hz sinusoidal, 1.8-3.8 mT magnetic field one hour daily for 14 days. Rats of the second group were sham exposed, with the applicator solenoid turned off. On the day after the final exposure the evaluations were made of the rat's spontaneous irritability, oral activity, and catalepsy.

One watershed was 0.877 square miles and the other 44.0 square miles in area. In the case of the smaller watershed detailed attention was given to the influence of various model parameters on stream flow for specific time intervals (annual, monthly, daily, and individual storms). Different parameters have distinctly different influences in this regard. Very good prediction of annual streamflow and reasonably good prediction of monthly streamflow were attained. Storm hydrographs were simulated less accurately. Peak flow rates were particularly poorly matched on the smaller watershed, although the times of occurrence of hydrograph peaks were accurately simulated. However, high flow frequency curves for simulated and recorded flows were in acceptable agreement. (Author)"}

This #EthicsMatters brief focuses on these specific questions\u2013just in time for the 2019 Annual Lobbyist Registration due\u2013January 15. So, who is a lobbyists and therefore needs to register?\n\nLobbying at a Glance\u2026\n\n2018 Lobbyist Registration\u2026\n\nWho?The Miami-Dade County Code defines lobbyists as \u201cany person firm or corporation seeking to influence any action, decision or recommendation of County Personnel\u201d including the Mayor and Board of County Commissioners.\n\nWhat? The Miami-Dade County Code requires that individuals retained as a lobbyists register with the Clerk of the Board within five days of being retained by a client or before engaging in any lobbying activity. Any existing registrations must be renewed at the beginning of each year."}

To help them justify the arrest, the police will probably ask you to perform field sobriety tests at the arrest scene.\n\nFor example, they might administer the horizontal gaze nystagamus (HGN, where your eyes follow an object that the officer is holding in his hand). They may additionally ask you to recite the ABC's, perform the walk-and-turn test (commonly referred to as \"walking a straight line\"), and the one-legged-stand.\n\nPortable breath test\n\nYou may be asked to blow into a machine at the scene of the arrest. This machine is known as a Portable Breath Test (PBT). If the results of the PBT show that you are over the legal limit of .08, the police will use those results in court to establish grounds to arrest you.\n\nHowever, the PBT results are not admissible in the DUI prosecution, and your refusal to blow into the PBT will not result in any action"}

However, it appears they're hardly the only Canadian university engaging in fraud.\n\nThe Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) reports they gave more than $12 million to projects in which researchers have been found to be violating research ethics or integrity rules since 2003. Those schools include Dalhousie University, McGill University, McMaster University, Sunnybrook & Women's College Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia, Universite de Montreal, and Universite de Sherbrooke.\n\nThis is my favourite section in the piece:\n\nCIHR has also complained that its investigations are hampered by government secrecy and unco-operative universities. The documents released by CIHR reveal universities, in some cases, have let misconduct investigations drag on so long that researchers accused of faking results or unethical conduct had moved on to new jobs or left the country.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSo MUN is in good company, apparently. I guess the only difference is that none of these schools, so far, have had hour long documentaries done on their fraud on national television. Still, you can't"}

However, in this case, re-purposing your public website or eCom for in-store experience is the worst idea possible. Not only will it NOT achieve an ROI, but it will erode store value.\n\nConsider the following 5 points:\n\nPerception. \u2013 Using your public website to power In-Store experience sends the message: \u201cI could have done this at home?\u201d Not a horrible message.

Many center-right blogs I read have people drawing a strong line between their conservatism and Bush's Republicans. The Republican Party is in serious trouble. On Monday CBS News (.pdf) released a survey showing 71 percent of Americans believing the country is headed in the wrong direction and just 33 percent of Americans approving of President Bush. That is overwhelmingly positive for Democrats, but the internals of the poll brought even better news. A majority of Americans say they want Democrats rather than Republicans to control Congress (51 percent to 34 percent). That's the largest gap recorded by AP-Ipsos since Bush took office. Even 31 percent of conservatives want Republicans out of power.\n\nSo what are Republican loyalists and conservatives to do? Dignan is so disgusted that he has declared he may not vote in 2006.

Many of these are uncannily similar and some are more important to others.

MacVicar pointed out that in America, \"federal law entitles some working mothers to twelve weeks unpaid leave,\" before cautioning that \"the rest get nothing.\"\n\nMacVicar relayed that French women enjoy more benefits than their American counterparts: \"Take a look at what all French families, regardless of income, are entitled to: Up to three years paid maternity leave with a guarantee that mom's job will be there for her when she returns.

{"text": "History of Tobacco\n\nWhat is Tobacco?Tobacco is a plant, related to the eggplant family. It is planted in order to harvest its leaves for the production of cigarettes, cigars, snuff (sneezewort) and quid. Tobacco is an annual plant and only lives for one season. The height of plant ranges between 1.2 and 1.8 meters and one sapling produces about 20 leaves, each of 60 \u2013 75 cm in length and 35 \u2013 45 cm in width.\n\nNamingThe scientific name of tobacco is Nicotiana, and is where we get the name of nicotine from. Botanist Carl Linius of Sweden named the plant in honor of Jan Nicot, the French ambassador to Portugal, who sent the tobacco plant to the palace of Catherine De Midichi in 1559 for use as medicine.\n\nThe History and Development of Tobacco The origin of tobacco growing goes back to the American continent, where the aboriginal inhabitants used it in religious ceremonies and as a pain killer. Following Christopher Columbus' discovery of America, sailors brought tobacco with them when they returned to Europe. The use of tobacco spread due to European belief that it could be used to heal a variety of diseases.\n\nBy 1600, tobacco was"}

Al\u201330Si\u20135Fe ribbons produced by the melt-spinning process were pulverized and subsequently consolidated at 300 \u00b0C in an argon atmosphere. Prepared specimens were thixoformed at temperatures ranging from 580 to 700 \u00b0C for various holding times. Some cast samples were also directly thixoformed as reference. In all thixoformed samples, microstructures were modified and needle-like intermetallic compounds as well as silicon particles in the as-cast part were changed into rounded corners or polygonal shapes with uniform distribution. Macro-hardness of up to 165 HV10 (which is almost twice as much as-cast sample) was obtained from a meltspun sample held for 5 min at 700 \u00b0C and then thixoformed.

{"text": "Smoother than Silk\n\nBerlin (Germany), December 7, 2016. Freudenberg Sealing Technologies is presenting a new generation of low-friction transmission seals at the 15th International CTI Symposium, the meeting place for transmission experts. Levitas seal rings are suited for installation in all forms of automated transmissions. A special seal design produces a hydrodynamic oil film between the seal ring and its dynamic counter surface. This reduces friction to the point that merely replacing conventional transmission seals in an automatic transmission reduces the vehicle\u2019s CO2 emissions by 0.8 grams per kilometer. If a million new vehicles were equipped with Levitas seals, the total emissions over their entire operating life would decline by 192,000 tons.\n\nWhether it is automatic, double-clutch or continuously variable, the transmission is one main determinant of the efficiency of a vehicle\u2019s powertrain. That\u2019s why every transmission manufacturer is working on minimizing frictional losses. Seals are responsible for about one-quarter of all the lost mechanical energy in automatic transmissions. They keep the oil pressure in the transmission at the prescribed level, making it possible to shift gears perfectly. The key is to keep the amount of oil that flows past the seal very low. \u201cToday low leakage and minimal friction"}

{"text": "Coping With Thinning Eyelashes\n\nWhile most discussions of hair loss focus on head hair, there are other places where it can be a problem, too. One of the most noticeable of these is the eyelashes. Not only can thinning eyelashes make you look odd, they also reduce the protection your eyes receive against dust and the elements. How common is eyelash loss, what causes it, and what can you do about it?\n\nCauses of Eyelash Thinning\n\nMost people find that their eyelashes get a little thinner as they age. Usually this is not very severe and doesn't cause much of a problem, but a few people are genetically predisposed to lose more of their eyelashes as they get older. Stress can also contribute to the process, as can Hormonal Changes associated with pregnancy and the menopause, though in these cases the effects are often temporary.\n\nOccasionally eyelash loss can be symptomatic of other conditions. The most common of these are thyroid problems, so if you find that your eyelashes are thinning and you are also feeling fatigued, putting on weight or experiencing muscle cramps, it's a good idea to speak to your doctor (most thyroid problems can be easily treated)."}

The first edition is now on select newsagent shelves and inside the back cover, in The Insiders double page gossip column, is a half page story on Miranda Kerr. No, not a pregnancy update, but a (censored) topless image of an 18 year-old Kerr taken in 2002, together with the headline \"Kerr's naked fury\". The story goes on to feign outrage and outline how \"an old friend\" of Kerr's has \"taken advantage\" of her new-found celebrity to sell what are believed to be the first topless images of Kerr to a British tabloid for a \"hefty\" fee. The photographer is quoted as saying he previously refrained from selling the shots to a mens magazine because \"they were too nice\". So a Fleet Street tabloid is a far more tasteful alternative then? But while the photographer has got no problem with flogging eight year old topless images of teenage Kerr, he asked not to be named.

{"text": "Comparison of effectiveness of convection-, transpiration-, and film-cooling methods with air as coolant\n\nE. R. G. Eckert, N. B. Livingoodnaca-report-11821954\n\nVarious parts of aircraft propulsion engines that are in contact with hot gases often require cooling. Transpiration and film cooling, new methods that supposedly utilize cooling air more effectively than conventional convection cooling, have already been proposed. This report presents material necessary for a comparison of the cooling requirements of these three methods. Correlations that are regarded by the authors as the most reliable today are employed in evaluating each of the cooling processes. Calculations for the special case in which the gas velocity is constant along the cooled wall (flat plate) are presented. The calculations reveal that a comparison of the three cooling processes can be made on quite a general basis. The superiority of transpiration cooling is clearly shown for both laminar and turbulent flow. This superiority is reduced when the effects of radiation are included; for gas-turbine blades, however, there is evidence indicating that radiation may be neglected."}

On the whole, this method is used to help secure computers and networks against future attacks. The general idea is to discover security issues by using the same tools and techniques as an attacker. These findings can then be mitigated before a real hacker exploits them.\n\nIt is necessary to spend a few minutes discussing the difference between penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. Many people and vendors in the security community incorrectly use these terms mutually.\n\nA vulnerability assessment is a process of evaluating services and systems for possible security issues, whereas a penetration test actually performs exploitation and Proof of Concept (PoC) attacks to verify that a security issue exists. Penetration tests go a step beyond vulnerability assessments by simulating hacker activity and delivering live payloads.\n\nEslam"}

Joseph\u2019s early childhood exhibited some classic signs and signals that he was both more sensitive than other boys and that he had a predilection for glitter and sparkle. Joseph began having troubles in school after kindergarten. The book follows Joseph all the way to high school and clearly documents how challenging it can be for children to grow up gay even in this post Will & Grace, Glee embracing age.\n\nThrough reading this book, I\u2019ve come to realize that Joseph and I have much in common. I was much like Joseph the way Schwartz describes him: a strong reader, not interested in sports and more withdrawn at school than at home. Joseph\u2019s grandmother noted early on that Joseph preferred the pink shirt. At age three Joseph wanted to be a disco lady at Halloween. \u201cAtta boy\u201d, I thought. \u201cThis is one of my people.\u201d\n\nJoseph encountered the same issues I did in the public education system.

{"text": "Muslim Aid and Charity\n\nIn Islamic society, money is not important. What important is, is the use of money. One may not have much money but the way he uses it can not only be his reward and prize in this world but also in the hereafter. In the initial years of Islamic revival in Arabia, Muslims were not so much in wealth. The importance of wealth was known so our beloved prophet Muhammad pbuh urged Muslims to give Aid charity and help those in need.\n\nThe concept of charity is not only limited to pay yearly obligated zakah. It has more to it. Even a penny given in the name of ALLAH is charity. A smile for parents is charity. So charity is not limited to money only, a help in time of need, a knowledge shared, a smile shared becomes charity as long as it is beneficial for the society. In holy Quran, ALLAh swt has mentioned about charity on many places. In the following verse, ALLAH swt say;\n\n2:271 It is good if you (give openly and) let your charity be known. But truly excellent it would be, if you give to the poor and let your"}

In a public company, equity has a knownish value: there\u2019s that day\u2019s market price, which might be different tomorrow but probably not be drastically so.

Falling between the cracks are unaccompanied homeless youth, an especially vulnerable group. Because homeless youth are notoriously difficult to study and perceived as delinquent runaways, data and services for this group are severely lacking. Instead of receiving the supports necessary to develop the social and emotional skills required for independent living and productive adulthood, homeless youth are often left to fend for themselves on the street or to \u201ccouch surf.\u201d The combination of an unstable childhood and lack of safe alternatives leaves homeless youth at greater risk of physical and sexual victimization, mental and physical health problems, and substance-abuse issues than their housed peers.

The FoldiMate folds and freshens your laundry for you\n\n\"Imagine handing over your laundry to a friend who folds it for you\" is the rather deft way in which FoldiMate describes the benefits of its robotic clothes folding machine. The firm says its device can cut in half the time spent on the laborious task of clothes folding, albeit for a rather hefty outlay.\n\nFoldiMate was set up in 2012 and ran an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign the following year to develop what was, at the time, a prototypical version of its idea. A further three years of development have turned the FoldiMate into a refined 28 x 32 x 31-in (71 x 81 x 79-cm) version that can dewrinkle, treat and fold most items of laundry. That's about washer-sized and it's designed to be stacked on top of a washer or dryer.\n\nThe FoldiMate Family, as the first commercially available version is called, is designed to minimize folding hassle in the home. Rather than folding each item of freshly washed clothing in turn and with varying degrees of quality, the user simply clips 15-20 items of onto the front of the machine. The FoldiMate then takes them"}
{"text": "Science Times: Increasing the Relevance of Optogenetics to the Human Brain: Novel Platform for Nonhuman Primates\n\nOptogenetics involves the transfer to neurons of a gene encoding a transmembrane protein, which, on exposure to specific wavelengths of light, undergoes a conformational change, causing the channel to open and the neuron to change its firing rate. The specificity of modulation that is potentially achievable with on-demand optogenetics has led to the suggestion that discoveries made in animal models can have implications in the clinical setting, including in the development of closed-loop neuromodulation devices.1 Realizing the potential of optogenetics to relate brain function to behavior that is most relevant to the human brain, however, requires the use of this tool in nonhuman primate (NHP) experiments. Similarly, close parallels between the organization of the human and NHP brains have allowed the use of single-neuron recording and microstimulation in the NHP to inform models of human cognition and clinical practice. However, these techniques suffer from a lack of cell specificity; microstimulation and the local administration of pharmacological agents both activate neurons nonspecifically, whereas microstimulation also may activate fibers of passage."}

The conference not only agreed to reserve airwaves for TV but also to park further discussion on this topic until the next-but-one conference in 2023.\n\nHowever, there are continued concerns over the future of openly available TV services that don't rely on expensive equipment or mobile or broadband contracts and data allowances controlled by companies who offer rival TV services and over the cost of upgrading infrastructure in the future.\n\nWriting in a blog post, Jon Steel warned about ongoing developments which despite the conference outcome look set to pose a threat for terrestrial TV.

Directed by Joe Dante (GREMLINS), this frantic comedy screams out the 1980s which is too bad as it would have played better if Corey Feldman's teen dude, to name just one example, had been eliminated. The acting is very broad and over the top (except by the two female leads) but once you get accustomed to the feverish style of the film, most of it is very amusing albeit far fetched. I can't help but wonder if the film's ending was changed somewhere along the line (after previews?). Hanks gives a terrific speech that would seem to emphasize the film's theme and it would have been the perfect time to end the film. But at the very end, it confirms the paranoia of the main protagonists. Jerry Goldsmith contributed the clever underscore.

Their achievement is detailed in a paper published online in the current issue of the scientific journal Algal Research.\n\nThe ability to genetically transform marine algae into a biofuel crop is important because it expands the kinds of environments in which algae can be conceivably grown for biofuels. Corn, for example, which is used to produce ethanol biofuel, requires prime farmland and lots of fresh water. But the UC San Diego study suggests that algal biofuels can be produced in the ocean or in the brackish water of tidelands or even on agricultural land on which crops can no longer be grown because of high salt content in the soil.\n\n\u201cWhat our research shows is that we can achieve in"}

It holds up better partly because Miller is dealing here with issues that have fresh relevance in the age of Haliburton and Enron: the evils of war profiteering and the moral duty of individuals to resist the soulless influence of American business.

In China, the world's most populous country, average emissions of CO2 increased by 9% to 7.2 tonnes per capita. China is now within the range of 6 to 19 tonnes per capita emissions of the major industrialised countries. In the European Union, CO2 emissions dropped by 3% to 7.5 tonnes per capita. The United States remain one of the largest emitters of CO2, with 17.3 tones per capita, despite a decline due to the recession in 2008-2009, high oil prices and an increased share of natural gas.

{"text": "Secondary Expansion Chamber\n\nThe secondary expansion chamber surrounds the combustion chamber. The purpose of this chamber is to convert exhaust gas heat into additional power. Other inventors have attempted this and essentially they develop a topping cycle. In other words, they take the high temperature exhaust as a heat source for a secondary power loop with heat exchanger. Another approach is to use the exhaust gases to preheat the incoming air to obtain higher combustion temperature. In general, gases have low heat transfer ability so their results have been weak. The heat transfer problem was solved here by mixing the combustion gases directly with cold air.\n\nThe secondary expansion chamber is almost a mirror of the supercharger which is directly opposite the secondary expansion chamber. The fixed partition separates the two. During the power stroke, the secondary expansion chamber fills with cold air through the reeds valves (see the first figure below). Then near the end of the power stroke, the combustion gases rush into the secondary expansion chamber. The gases are trapped and try to expand and push the secondary expansion chamber piston. Since this piston is directly connected to the supercharger piston (which is in its compression stroke),"}

Phoenician, Greek and Roman peoples all sailed the Mediterranean Sea and colonized the lands on its shores. Carthage, founded by the Phoenicians about 814 BC, speedily grew into a city without rival in the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians subdued the Berber tribes who, then as now, formed the bulk of the population, and became masters of all the habitable region of North Africa.Greeks founded the city of Cyrene in Ancient Libya around 631 BC. Cyrenaica became a flourishing colony, though being hemmed in on all sides by absolute desert it had little or no influence on inner Africa. The three powers of Cyrenaica, Egypt and Carthage were eventually supplanted by the Romans. After centuries of rivalry with Rome, Carthage finally fell in 146 BC. Within little more than a century Egypt and Cyrene had become incorporated in the Roman empire. Interaction between Asia, Europe and North Africa during this period was significant; major effects include the spread and the cross pollination of culture.\n\n1812 map of Africa by Arrowsmith and Lewis"}

The feedback was it was 1) a strong application but did not fit the criteria for TDG and 2) that it sparked a conversation about the need for a stream of funding for developing scholarship at UTAS.\nAcademics (including me when I have been contracted to teach) tend to do unit level innovations that are not connected to the course outcomes AND which are interrupted by changing teaching loads.

Jim Jacobi began recording in 1977 and released what has been known as one of the first DIY (Do It Yourself) records, called Victims of the Media in 1978.

Girls were pretty but wispy \u2014 though they sounded stronger as I walked over to Washed Out, who had the audience clapping along to his set. It also helped that Ernest Greene plays to the audience, not his instruments. Beach House played with several glittering, large diamonds behind them for their second Pitchfork Festival show (they played two years ago). Victoria Legrand stayed half hidden by layers of wavy hair, but Alex Scally paused to warn us: \u201cIf anyone has dry underwear by the end of this song, you have to leave the festival,\u201d he said, before playing \u201cSilver Soul.\u201d Local Natives\u2019 harmonies sounded impressively tight, despite some sound problems.\n\nLightning Bolt played the main stage at 4:15, and they were exactly what Sunday needed to wake up. They usually play on the floor and not on stage, but that wasn\u2019t feasible at this show, so the band inched as close to the front of the stage as possible."}

The actress has a penchant for tattoos \u2014 and by that, we mean she loves tattooing other people. In fact, Margot once gave Suicide Squad costar Cara Delevingne a tiny smiley face on her toe to commemorate their time on-set, dubbing the ink a \"toemoji.\" Plus, who could forget the time she reportedly tattooed her wedding guests, giving them a rather unexpected lifelong commitment. It seems Margot has only continued her tattooing hobby since then, considering what went down on a recent episode of The Graham Norton Show. According to Refinery29, Margot revealed that she's given almost 100 tattoos at this point, and then decided to add to that number on-camera.\n\nDuring the segment, her fellow guests Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling got away unscathed, but Margot eventually found a willing canvas from Adam, a member of Graham's production crew and self-professed Margot Robbie fan.

How can you promote the health and safety of your patients when their decisions to refuse vaccines threaten public safety? How do you reason with patients who insist on the harmful effects of vaccines against overwhelming evidence to the contrary?\n\nAccording to a recent CBS news poll, 66% of Americans say MMR vaccines should be required, leaving nearly a third who think parents should be able to decide, even with the recent outbreaks.

Anti-vaxxer patients who identify with natural or alternative health movements and buy the anti vaccine movement's wildly unsubstantiated claims that link vaccines to autism.\n\nBecause many anti-vaxxer patients are emotionally motivated by fear, it can be difficult or even impossible to convince them to vaccinate.

Having previously worked on a project which used a reasonably sized (100 nodes) Hadoop cluster running on EC2 I am familiar with many of the pains of setting up and running Hadoop on EC2. The reason why I found this announcement so surprising is that it demonstrates Amazons willingness provide even more middleware services. Many of the other AWS services like S3, SQS, and SDB provide very fundamental services, namely storage and queuing. I'm not saying that everyone on AWS uses all three services, but instead that just about everything running on EC2 requires some form of storage and some form of queuing. Thus if Amazon can provide the services that just about everyone needs, there is a decent chance that Amazon can get some of those people to use their services either as a result of convenience or cost. MapReduce is definately quite popular right now, and for good reason, but it is a far-cry away from being as fundamental as something like storage.\n\nThe point of that whole discussion is this, Amazon just made their first true Platform-as-a-Service"}

This diagram is simplified to show their essential differences. The chemistry of the processes used to make sodium alginate from brown seaweeds is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations which are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates which hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and which resist filtration and centrifugation.\n\nTo extract the alginate in the seaweed caustic soda is added to convert the seaweed to water-soluble sodium alginate.\n\nThe aqueous alginate solution is further processed through a clarification procedure. Since the aqueous alginate solution is very thick at this stage, the solution is diluted with large amount of water then clarified.\n\nThe seaweed extract is filtered to separate the sodium alginate solution from the cellulose contained in the fibrous seaweed residue.\n\nAn acid is added to isolate the alginic acid from the diluted sodium alginate solution.\n\nThis allows the insoluble alginic acid to be isolated.

{"text": "CUOS 2019: Lymph Node Dissection at the Time of Nephrectomy - CON\n\nToronto, Ontario (UroToday.com) The concept of lymph node dissection (LND) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is controversial. Past studies have reported mixed results. Population-based studies demonstrate that LND rates during surgery are decreasing in the US.1 However, some of the larger more experienced centers report an increased rate of LND.2 Recent data from the national cancer database (NCDB) demonstrate an LND usage of 5%, 23%, 31%, 47%, of T1, T2, T3, T4, respectively receiving LND.3 The likelihood of lymph node metastases varies by stage and grade with 1.1-5.1% of T1 disease and up to 12.3-37.1% in T4 disease.4\n\nThe potential benefits of LND include:\n\nImproved survival?\n\nImproved staging (prognosis)\n\nThe potential harms include:\n\nLonger recovery\n\nIncreased complications\n\nCT scans which are the most commonly used diagnostic imaging for identification of suspicious lymph nodes (with a cutoff of 1 cm) have a positive predictive value of 56% and a negative predictive value 90%. This means that half the positive lymph nodes on CT are actually not metastases.\n\nThere is only one randomized controlled trial (EORTC 30881 \u2013 Blom 2009) that assessed the correlation between LND and survival in these"}
