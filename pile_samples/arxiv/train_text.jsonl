Interactive recommender systems present an opportunity to engage the user in the process by allowing them to interact with the recommendations, provide feedback and impact the results in real-time. Evaluation of the impact of the user interaction typically requires an extensive user study which is time consuming and gives researchers limited opportunities to tune their solutions without having to conduct multiple rounds of user feedback.

We begin by generalizing to Dedekind domains the arithmetic functions known as Schemmel totient functions, and we use one of these generalizations to provide a simple formula, for any positive integer $m$, for the number of cliques of order $m$ in a generalized totient graph. We then proceed to determine many properties of generalized totient graphs such as their clique numbers, chromatic numbers, chromatic indices, clique domination numbers, and (in many, but not all cases) girths. We also determine the diameter of each component of a generalized totient graph. We correct one erroneous claim about the clique domination"}

Observations indicate that the halo of a galaxy like the milky way has almost an order of magnitude fewer small satellite halos than is found in CDM simulations [@moore; @ghigna].\n\nAlso, the central cores of dark matter halos have singular density profiles, approaching almost $\\rho \\propto r^{-1.5}$ at small $r$ [@NFW96; @FP94; @N99; @NS99; @moore2].

One way of getting additional information is to analyse three-time besides the standard two-time correlation functions, as realized by multidimensional NMR experiments. On this basis it is possible to decide whether the non-exponentiality is mainly due to a homogeneous scenario (intrinsic non-exponentiality related to systematic back- and forth dynamics) or a heterogeneous scenario (superposition of different exponential processes). In a previous publication these concepts have been applied to computer simulations of a hard sphere system which experimentally is well represented by colloidal suspensions [@vanMegen]. There we observed that the dynamics at short times ($\\beta$-regime) is dominated by the presence of a cage formed by surrounding particles. This results in a systematic back-dragging effect, corresponding to a mainly homogeneous scenario. In the $\\alpha$-regime most particles have escaped their initial cages.

A particularly interesting example is chiral charge pumping, the so-called chiral anomaly, in recently discovered topological Weyl semimetals, where simultaneous application of parallel DC electric and magnetic fields creates an imbalance in the number of carriers of opposite topological charge (chirality). Here, using time-resolved terahertz measurements on the Weyl semimetal TaAs in a magnetic field, we optically interrogate the chiral anomaly by dynamically pumping the chiral charges and monitoring their subsequent relaxation. Theory based on Boltzmann transport shows that the observed effects originate from an optical nonlinearity in the chiral charge pumping process.

They occur when quantities such as correlation functions of local operators, or scattering amplitudes are computed in perturbation theory. Beyond the lowest order in perturbation theory, integrals over $D$-dimensional space time over (rational) propagator factors have to be evaluated.\n\nOur ability to evaluate Feynman integrals in perturbation theory is critical for connecting quantum field theory to experiment. For example, in order to make precise theoretical predictions for collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), higher-order Feynman integrals for complicated kinematical processes are a crucial ingredient, see e.g. [@Gehrmann:2014vva]. This not only applies to virtual amplitudes, but, via the optical theorem, also to phase space integrals and to cross sections [@Anastasiou:2002yz; @Anastasiou:2003yy]. Other applications include statistical field theory, where critical exponents can be computed; higher order calculations are also important for instance for a better theoretical description of the anomalous magnetic moments. From the mathematical point of view it is an interesting question to ask what class of functions Feynman integrals give rise to. These are typically functions of a set of parameters,"}

This approach is particularly useful for developing FDR controlling procedures, which is simplified as the problem of developing per-family error rate (PFER) controlling procedures. Specifically, for testing hypotheses with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, by using the general approach, under the assumption of independence, we first develop a specific PFER controlling procedure and based on this procedure, then develop a new FDR controlling procedure, which can preserve the desired DAG structure among the rejected hypotheses.

Among these TF methods, the synchrosqueezing transform successfully illustrates the physical mechanisms in the multiphoton ionization regime and in the tunneling ionization regime.

For weak repulsive interspecies interactions the impurity oscillates within the bosonic gas. At strong repulsions and depending on its prequench position the impurity moves towards an edge of the bosonic medium and subsequently equilibrates. This equilibration being present independently of the initial velocity, the position and the mass of the impurity is inherently related to the generation of entanglement in the many-body system. Focusing on attractive interactions the impurity performs a damped oscillatory motion within the bosonic bath, a behavior that becomes more evident for stronger attractions. To elucidate our understanding of the dynamics an effective potential picture is constructed. The effective mass of the emergent quasiparticle is measured and found to be generically larger than the bare one, especially for strong attractions. In all cases, a transfer of energy from the impurity to the bosonic medium takes place. Finally, by averaging over a sample of simulated in-situ single-shot images we expose how the single-particle density distributions and the two-body interspecies correlations can be probed.'\nauthor:\n- 'S.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'In this article, we present a systematic study in developing machine learning interatomic potential (MLIAP) for elemental silicon. Previously, many of MLIAP applications involve fitting models to small or localized training sets, which do not allow for transferability. The need for transferability of MLIAP is crucial in sampling the vast phase space in the application of crystal structure prediction. To address for this need, we indicate that two primary factors can have major influences on the transferability of the MLIAP. First, transferability depends strongly on the diversity of the training data set. In particular, the use of a random structures generating algorithm based on crystal symmetry is a suitable methodology for generating a training data set with sufficient diversity. Second, we introduce a framework that allows Gaussian symmetry functions and bispectrum coefficients descriptors to be fitted with generalized linear regression or neural network. According to our substantial benchmark, the best accuracy trained on the diverse data set can be achieved by using a flexible machine learning method coupled with highly orthogonal descriptors. Therefore, we will show that neural network potential fitting with bispectrum coefficients as the descriptor is a feasible method for obtaining high-quality and transferable MLIAP.'\nauthor:"}

Whereas flexible polymers are governed by conformational entropy and typically adsorb in random coil configurations, the morphologies of semiflexible polymers with large persistence lengths are dominated by their bending rigidity, which gives rise to well-defined shapes: An open polymer adsorbs in a straight configuration, whereas a closed polymer ring forms a circular loop.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'Penalized regression methods aim to retrieve reliable predictors among a large set of putative ones from a limited amount of measurements. In particular, penalized regression with singular penalty functions is important for sparse reconstruction algorithms. For large-scale problems, these algorithms exhibit sharp phase transition boundaries where sparse retrieval breaks down. Large optimization problems associated with sparse reconstruction have been analyzed in the literature by setting up corresponding statistical mechanical models at a finite temperature. Using replica method for mean field approximation, and subsequently taking a zero temperature limit, this approach reproduces the algorithmic phase transition boundaries. Unfortunately, the replica trick and the non-trivial zero temperature limit obscure the underlying reasons for the failure of a sparse reconstruction algorithm, and of penalized regression methods, in general. In this paper, we employ the \u201ccavity method\u201d to give an alternative derivation of the mean field equations, working directly in the zero-temperature limit. This derivation provides insight into the origin of the different terms in the self-consistency conditions. The cavity method naturally involves a quantity, the average local susceptibility, whose behavior distinguishes different phases in this system. This susceptibility can be generalized for analysis of a broader class of sparse reconstruction algorithms.'"}

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'The chemical separation of Li$^+$ ions induced by a magnetic field during the hierarchical structure formation can reduce initial Li abundances in cosmic structures. It is shown that cosmological reionization of neutral Li atoms quickly completes as soon as the first star is formed. Since almost all Li is singly ionized during the main course of structure formation, it can efficiently separate from gravitationally collapsing neutral gas. The separation is more efficient in smaller structures which formed earlier. In the framework of the hierarchical structure formation, extremely metal-poor stars can have smaller Li abundances because of their earlier formations. It is found that the chemical separation by a magnetic field thus provides a reason that Li abundances in extremely metal-poor stars are lower than the Spite plateau and have a large dispersion as well as an explanation of the Spite plateau itself. In addition, the chemical separation scenario can explain Li abundances in NGC 6397 which are higher than the Spite plateau.

In the first stage, we decouple the image into reflection and illumination parts by solving a convex energy minimization model with either total variation or tight-frame regularisation. In the second stage, we segment the original image by thresholding on the reflection part, and the inhomogeneous intensity is estimated by the smoothly varying illumination part.

There are, on average, oscillating water-rich and fluorocarbon-rich regions, in agreement with experimental results from neutron reflectometry. Water diffusivity shows increasing directional anisotropy of up to 30% with decreasing film thickness, depending of the confining material. The percolation analysis revealed significant differences in water clustering and connectivity with the confining material. These findings indicate the fundamentally different nature of ionomer thin films, compared to membranes, and suggest explanations for increased ionic resistances observed in the catalyst layer.'\nauthor:\n- 'P.

Models make evident that the unstable wavelengths are very long compared to thermally unstable wavelengths, with implications for star formation in the outer galaxy and low surface brightness disks. The perennial question of the factors determining the hot gas filling factor in a SN-driven medium remains open, in particular because of the unexpectedly strong turbulent mixing at the boundaries of hot cavities seen in the models.

Disks are also the birthplace of planetary bodies. A particularly challenging problem is how to reconcile the relatively long timescales for planet formation ($>$10Myr, Bodenheimer et al.\u00a0[@bodenheimer00]) and the rather quick destruction of circumstellar disks (e.g.\u00a0Haisch et al.\u00a0[@haisch01a]). Amongst the many (yet) unanswered disk-related questions are: what are the timescales of disk dissipation; how does the chemical and physical evolution of dust proceed from small interstellar dust grains through pebble-sized particles to larger bodies? And how does the local physical environment (in particular in OB associations) influence these processes?\n\nCircumstellar disks have traditionally been identified from near-infrared (near-IR) colours ($JHK$). Recently, several L-band surveys of young stellar populations proved that the K-band excess is a rather incomplete and unreliable disk indicator.

{"text": "---\nabstract: |\n    We develop a gauge theory for diffusive and precessional spin dynamics in two-dimensional electron gas with disorder. Our approach reveals a direct connections between the absence of the equilibrium spin current and strong anisotropy in the spin relaxation: both effects arise if the spin-orbit coupling is reduced to a pure gauge $SU(2)$ field. In this case, by a gauge transformation in the form of a local $%\n    SU(2)$ rotation in the spin subspace the spin-orbit coupling can be removed. The resulting spin dynamics is exactly described in terms of two kinetic coefficients: the spin diffusion and electron mobility. After the inverse transformation, full diffusive and precessional spin density dynamics, including the anisotropic spin relaxation, formation of stable spin structures, and spin precession induced by a macroscopic current, is restored. Explicit solutions of the spin evolution equations are found for the initially uniform spin density and for stable nonuniform structures.

The fused density comprises a set of fusion hypotheses that grow exponentially with the number of Bernoulli components. Thus, GCI fusion with MB filters can become computationally intractable in practical applications that involve tracking of even a moderate number of objects. In order to accelerate the multi-sensor fusion procedure, we derive a theoretically sound approximation to the fused density. The number of fusion hypotheses in the resulting density is significantly smaller than the original fused density. It also has a parallelizable structure that allows multiple clusters of Bernoulli components to be fused independently. By carefully clustering Bernoulli components into isolated clusters using the GCI divergence as the distance metric, we propose an alternative to build exactly the approximated density without exhaustively computing all the fusion hypotheses. The combination of the proposed approximation technique and the fast clustering algorithm can enable a novel and fast GCI-MB fusion implementation. Our analysis shows that the"}

Yet, coming up with meaningful interpretations of the estimated clusters has often been challenging precisely due to its unsupervised nature.

By leveraging information from both supervising auxiliary variables and unlabeled data, we seek to uncover more scientifically interpretable group structures that may be hidden by completely unsupervised analyses. In this work, we propose and develop a new statistical pattern discovery method named Supervised Convex Clustering (SCC) that borrows strength from both information sources and guides towards finding more interpretable patterns via a joint convex fusion penalty.

When $M$ is homogeneous and the action is free, the quotient, a smooth manifold, is called a biquotient. Alternatively, biquotients can be defined as quotients of compact Lie groups by two sided actions. More precisely, given a Lie group $G$ and a homomorphism $f = (f_1,f_2):H\\to G\\times G$, there is an induced action of $H$ on $G$ given by $h\\ast g = f_1(h)g f_2(h)^{-1}$. When this action is effectively free, the orbit space, denoted $G{/\\!\\!/}H$, naturally has the structure of a smooth manifold and is called a biquotient.\n\nIf $G$ is endowed with a bi-invariant metric, then the $H$ action on $G$ is by isometries, and hence induces a metric on the quotient.
