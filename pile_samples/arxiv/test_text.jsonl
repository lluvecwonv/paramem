In cells, cytoskeletal filaments and motor proteins exhibit activity and self-organization into complex structures important for cell mechanics, motility, and division. Collective dynamics of cytoskeletal systems can be reconstituted using filament gliding experiments, in which cytoskeletal filaments are propelled by surface-bound motor proteins. These experiments have observed diverse behavior, including flocks, polar streams, swirling vortices, and single filament spirals. Recent experiments with microtubules and kinesin motor proteins found that the effective repulsive interaction between filaments can be tuned by crowding agents in solution, altering the collective behavior. Adding a crowder reduced filament crossing, promoted alignment, and led to a transition from active, isotropically oriented filaments to locally aligned polar streams. These results suggest that tunable soft repulsion can control active phase behavior, but how altering steric interactions and filament stiffness alter collective motion is not fully understood. Here we use simulations of driven filaments with tunable soft repulsion and rigidity in order to better understand how the interplay between filament flexibility and steric effects can lead to different active steady states.

To better assess whether well-trained VQA models are vulnerable to potential attack such as more challenging distractors, we introduce a novel task called *textual Distractors Generation for VQA* (DG-VQA). The goal of DG-VQA is to generate the most confusing distractors in multi-choice VQA tasks represented as a tuple of image, question, and the correct answer. Consequently, such distractors expose the vulnerability of neural models.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'The mathematical theory of super-resolution developed recently by Cand\u00e8s and Fernandes-Granda states that a continuous, sparse frequency spectrum can be recovered with infinite precision via a (convex) atomic norm technique given a set of uniform time-space samples. This theory was then extended to the cases of partial/compressive samples and/or multiple measurement vectors via atomic norm minimization (ANM), known as off-grid/continuous compressed sensing (CCS). However, a major problem of existing atomic norm methods is that the frequencies can be recovered only if they are sufficiently separated, prohibiting commonly known high resolution. In this paper, a novel (nonconvex) sparse metric is proposed that promotes sparsity to a greater extent than the atomic norm. Using this metric an optimization problem is formulated and a locally convergent iterative algorithm is implemented. The algorithm iteratively carries out ANM with a sound reweighting strategy which enhances sparsity and resolution, and is termed as reweighted atomic-norm minimization (RAM).

The Berry phases in turn remove the degeneracies of energies for states near the Fermi surface, leading to a dynamical instability of the lattice with respect to the rotations.

To fit this model, a log-concave objective function known as the \u201cpartial likelihood\u201d is maximized. For moderate-sized datasets, an efficient Newton-Raphson algorithm that leverages the structure of the objective can be employed. However, in large datasets this approach has two issues: 1) The computational tricks that leverage structure can also lead to computational instability; 2) The objective does not naturally decouple: Thus, if the dataset does not fit in memory, the model can be very computationally expensive to fit. This additionally means that the objective is not directly amenable to stochastic gradient-based optimization methods. To overcome these issues, we propose a simple, new framing of proportional hazards regression: This results in an objective function that is amenable to stochastic gradient descent.

The case of accretion disks around supermassive active black holes (AGNs) is studied with the goal to explain some of the statistical properties of the observed IntraDay Variability (IDV). The region producing optical IDV is perturbed by allowing it to develop a mass density of a fractional Brownian Motion-like type. The light curves and spectral slopes are calculated and compared to observational data for different Hurst parameters. The spectral slopes of the simulated light curves vary in the range $(0.4,2.5)$. The agreement with observational data shows that a magnetized disk subjected to stochastic perturbations can produce some of the features observed in the light curves.\\\n    **Keywords**: accretion, accretion discs; magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); fractional Brownian Motion\nauthor:\n- 'G.

In this report I describe a way to combine the multi-agent framework *Jason*, an extended version of the agent-oriented programming language AgentSpeak, with Lego robots to address this problem. By extending parts of the *Jason* reasoning cycle I show how Lego robots are able to complete tasks such as following lines on a floor and communicating to be able to avoid obstacles with minimal amount of coding. The final implementation is a functional extension that is able to built multi-agent systems using Lego agents, however there are some issues that have not been addressed. If the agents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required to move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning cycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and can be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a multi-agent environment.'\nauthor:\n- Andreas Schmidt Jensen\ndate: 1 October 2010\ntitle: 'Implementing Lego Agents Using *Jason*'\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============"}

Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn\u2019s migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets\u2019 inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed.

The standard implementation of MI is based on the assumption of data being missing at random (MAR).

For an incomplete variable in a given dataset, its corresponding population marginal distribution might also be available in an external data source.

Synchronization of abundance has been widely observed across a range of spatial scales in relation to rate of dispersal among discrete populations. However, the dependence of synchrony on patterns of among-patch movement across heterogeneous landscapes has been largely ignored. Here we consider the duration of movement between two predator-prey communities connected by weak dispersal, and its effect on population synchrony. More specifically, we introduce time delayed dispersal to incorporate the finite transmission time between discrete populations across a continuous landscape. Reducing the system to a phase model using weakly connected network theory, it is found that the time delay is an important factor determining the nature and stability of phase-locked states. Our analysis predicts enhanced convergence to stable synchronous fluctuations in general, and a decreased ability of systems to produce in-phase synchronization dynamics in the presence of delayed dispersal. These results introduce delayed dispersal as a tool for understanding the importance of dispersal time across a landscape matrix in affecting metacommunity dynamics.

{"text": "---\nabstract: |\n    We develop a novel, general framework for the asymptotic reduction of the bias of $M$-estimators from unbiased estimating functions. The framework relies on additive, empirical adjustments to the estimating functions that depend only on the first two derivatives of the contributions to the estimating functions. The new estimation method has markedly broader applicability than previous bias-reduction methods by applying to models that are either partially-specified or that have a likelihood that is intractable or expensive to compute, and a surrogate objective is employed. The method also offers itself to easy, general implementations for arbitrary models by using automatic differentiation. This is in contrast to other popular bias-reduction methods that require either resampling or evaluation of expectations of products of log-likelihood derivatives. If $M$-estimation is by the maximization of an objective function, then, reduced-bias $M$-estimation can be achieved by maximizing an appropriately penalized objective. That penalized objective relates closely to information criteria based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, establishing, for the first time, a strong link between reduction of estimation bias and model selection. The reduced-bias $M$-estimators are found to have the same asymptotic distribution, and, hence, the same asymptotic efficiency properties as the original $M$-estimators, and we discuss"}

Recent developments in ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction indicate that spatial and temporal information can be collected simultaneously. In the present work, we push the capability of femtosecond transmission electron microscopy (fs-TEM) towards that of the state of the art in ultrafast lasers and electron microscopes.

A major consequence is that a change of gauge is not a unitary transformation in quantum mechanics; a principle heretofore unchallenged. The primacy of potentials over fields leads to the concept of a hierarchy of physical quantities, where potentials and energies are primary, while fields and forces are secondary. Secondary quantities provide less information than do primary quantities. Some criteria by which strong laser fields are judged are based on secondary quantities, making it possible to arrive at inappropriate conclusions.

We demonstrate that when numerical errors are reduced to below the physical perturbation and its exponential growth during integration the microscopic reversibility is retrieved. Time reversibility itself is not a guarantee for a definitive solution to the chaotic N-body problem. However, time reversible algorithms may be used to find initial conditions for which perturbed trajectories converge rather than diverge. The ability to calculate such a converging pair of solutions is a striking illustration which shows that it is possible to compute a definitive solution to a highly unstable problem.

Several examples are discussed to illustrate the convenience of the diagrammatic technique including the following: a two-dimensional Talbot-Lau effect, the shift in the echo time and the recoil phase for the interferometer perturbed by a quadratic potential; and the realization of a time-domain \u201cLau effect\u201d using a pulsed harmonic potential. The diagrammatic technique is applicable to diffraction gratings with arbitrary grating transmission functions. We conclude the paper with a general discussion on the Weyl function representations of matter-wave coherence, and relate the conservation of matter-wave coherence with the conservation of purity $\\varsigma={\\rm Tr}(\\hat \\rho^2)$ that distinguishes decoherence effects from dephasing effects.'\nauthor:\n- 'Saijun"}

Synthetic rough surfaces with controllable spectra were used to identify individual asperities, their locations and curvatures. The deterministic analysis enables to capture both particular deformation modes of individual rough surfaces and also statistical deformation regimes, which involve averaging over a big number of roughness realizations. Two regimes of contact area growth were identified: the Hertzian regime at light loads at the scale of a single asperity, and the linear regime at higher loads involving multiple contacting asperities. The transition between the regimes occurs at the load which depends on the second and the fourth spectral moments. It is shown that at light indentation the radius of circumference delimiting the contact area is always considerably larger than Hertzian contact radius. Therefore, it suggests that there is no scale separation in contact problems at light loads. In particular, the geometrical shape cannot be considered separately from the surface roughness at least for approaching greater than one standard roughness deviation.\n\n[**Keywords.**]{} roughness; indentation; contact; deterministic"}

However, Reinforcement-Learning-based control methods solely focus on the regulation problem or learn to track a reference that is generated by a time-invariant exo-system. In the latter case, controllers are only able to track the time-invariant reference dynamics which they have been trained on and need to be re-trained each time the reference dynamics change. Consequently, these methods fail in a number of applications which obviously rely on a trajectory not being generated by an exo-system. One prominent example is autonomous driving. This paper provides for the first time an adaptive optimal control method capable to track reference trajectories not being generated by a time-invariant exo-system.

Imposing stationarity of the total energy leads to a coupled system of partial differential equations, one enforcing stress equilibrium and another governing phase-field evolution. The two equations are coupled through an energy degradation function that models the loss of stiffness in the bulk material as it undergoes damage. In the present work, we introduce a new parametric family of degradation functions aimed at increasing the accuracy of phase-field models in predicting critical loads associated with crack nucleation as well as the propagation of existing fractures.

The models differ by their disc-to-halo mass ratios, and hence by their susceptibility to the formation of a bar and spiral structure. Seeded from shot noise in the particle distribution, bending waves rapidly form in both models and persist for many billions of years. Waves at intermediate radii manifest as corrugated structures in vertical position and velocity that are tightly wound, morphologically leading, and dominated by the $m=1$ azimuthal Fourier component. A spectral analysis of the waves suggests they are a superposition of modes from two continuous branches in the Galactocentric radius-rotational frequency plane. The lower-frequency branch is dominant and is responsible for the corrugated, leading, and warped structure. Over time, power in this branch migrates outward, lending credence to an inside-out formation scenario for the warp.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'The metallicity of a star strongly effects both its evolution and the properties of the stellar remnant that results from its demise. It is generally accepted that stars with initial masses below $\\sim 8\\,M_\\odot$ leave behind white dwarfs and that some sub-population of these lead to Type\u00a0Ia supernovae. However, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rate of SNe\u00a0Ia. We propose that a natural consequence of the effects of metallicity is to significantly increase the SN\u00a0Ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies. This is because lower-metallicity stars leave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should generally be easier to bring to an explosion. Using a simple model to relate the SN rate to galaxy age and metallicity, we find that the elevation in the rate of SNe\u00a0Ia in lower-mass galaxies measured by LOSS is readily explained. We also find that models using the same parameters agree well with cosmic SN\u00a0Ia rates up to $z\\approx2$.

We observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons on-top of the resonantly enhanced driving pulse. Surprisingly, the soliton pulse locks to the driving pulse enabling direct all-optical control of both the soliton\u2019s repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency without the need for any actuation on the microresonator.

The combined effects of gravity and radiation are illustrated in several typical figures which confirm that the particles are generically strongly influenced by the flux.

The ERPA is a renormalized RPA version which considers explicitly the depletion of the Fermi sea due to long-range correlations and thus allows us to examine how these affect the excitation spectra. It is found that the effect on the properties of giant resonances is rather small. Compared to the standard RPA, where excitations are built on top of the uncorrelated Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state, their centroid energies decrease by up to 1\u00a0MeV, approximately, in the isovector channel. The isoscalar response is less affected in general. Thus, the disagreement between our previous UCOM-based RPA calculations and the experimental data are to be attributed to other effects, mainly to a residual three-body force and higher-order configurations. Ground-state properties obtained within the ERPA are compared with corresponding HF and perturbation-theory results and are discussed as well. The ERPA formalism is presented in detail.'\nauthor:"}

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'Imputation of missing data is a common application in various classification problems where the feature training matrix has missingness. A widely used solution to this imputation problem is based on the lazy learning technique, $k$-nearest neighbor (kNN) approach. However, most of the previous work on missing data does not take into account the presence of the class label in the classification problem. Also, existing kNN imputation methods use variants of Minkowski distance as a measure of distance, which does not work well with heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative kNN imputation technique based on class weighted grey distance between the missing datum and all the training data. Grey distance works well in heterogeneous data with missing instances. The distance is weighted by Mutual Information (MI) which is a measure of feature relevance between the features and the class label. This ensures that the imputation of the training data is directed towards improving the classification performance. This class weighted grey kNN imputation algorithm demonstrates improved performance when compared to other kNN imputation algorithms, as well as standard imputation algorithms such as MICE and missForest, in imputation and classification problems.

Next, two sets of conditions are derived, under which the capacity region of the proposed model coincides with the capacity region of a three-user C-IFC in which all three messages are required at all receivers. Under these conditions, referred to as strong interference conditions, the capacity regions for the proposed three-user C-IFC are characterized.

For more adequate investigation of viral epidemic modelling, we suggest to apply branching processes with transport of particles usually called branching random walks (BRWs).

We consider two models of continuous-time BRWs on a multidimensional lattice in which the transport of infected individuals is described by a symmetric random walk on a multidimensional lattice whereas the processes of birth and death of infected individuals are represented by a continuous-time Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes at the lattice points (branching sources). A special attention is paid to the properties of branching random walks with one branching source on the lattice and finitely or infinitely many initial particles. We show that there exists a kind of duality between the branching random walk with a finite number of initial particles and the branching random walk with an infinite number of initial particles, which is associated with the possibility of their twofold description. The fact of duality is useful from the biological point of view. Each of the models can be considered taking into account the vaccination process."}

The ALMA data show well organized electric field orientations in most of the nebula and the inferred magnetic field vectors (rotated by 90 degrees) trace an hourglass morphology centred on the central system of the nebula. One region in the southern part of OH 231.8+4.2 shows a less organized distribution probably due to the shocked environment. These findings, in conjunction with earlier investigations (maser studies and dust emission analysis at other scales and wavelengths) suggest an overall magnetic hourglass located inside a toroidal field.

We show that this reheating can occur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star has evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner binary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because the outer star fills its Roche lobe, a substantial fraction of the dynamical ejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process.

In these cases, default implementations, which are often based on assumptions of a constant mean between changes and independent noise, can lead to substantial over-estimation of the number of changes. We propose a principled approach to detect such abrupt changes that models local fluctuations as a random walk process and autocorrelated noise via an AR(1) process. We then estimate the number and location of changepoints by minimising a penalised cost based on this model. We develop a novel and efficient dynamic programming algorithm, DeCAFS, that can solve this minimisation problem; despite the additional challenge of dependence across segments, due to the autocorrelated noise, which makes existing algorithms inapplicable.

The Tung-Orlando theory interprets this spectrum as a double downscale cascade of potential enstrophy and energy, from large scales to small scales, in which the downscale potential enstrophy cascade coexists with the downscale energy cascade over the same length-scale range.

In a systematic framework, we have calculated exactly the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric coefficients of borophane in the presence of the short-range, long-range charged impurity and the short-range electro-magnetic (SREM) scatterers, by using the exact solution of the Boltzmann transport equation within the linear-response theory. Contrary to the large electron-hole asymmetry in borophane, its electron-hole conductivity is nearly symmetric. Interestingly, for the short-range scatters, just like graphene, the short-range conductivities of borophane have the constant values, independent of the chemical potential, while the conductivities of the SREM scatterers are linearly dependent on the chemical potential. Regardless of the impurity type, the electric conductivity of borophane is highly anisotropic, while the Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit (${\\it ZT}$) are isotropic. Along with the ambipolar nature of the borophane thermopower, a very high value of ${\\it ZT}$ around unity is obtained at room temperature, due to the large asymmetry between electrons and holes in borophane.

We present explicit supergravity models in which a large but finite sgoldstino mass arises from Yukawa or gauge interactions. In both cases the inflaton potential receives two types of corrections.

In this paper, we propose a multiframe-based adaptive despeckling (MADS) algorithm to reconstruct a high-resolution B-mode image from raw radio-frequency (RF) data that is based on a multiple input single output (MISO) model. It utilizes the speckle patterns estimated using a novel multiframe-based adaptive approach for ultrasonic speckle noise estimation (MSNE) based on a single input multiple output (SIMO) modeling of consecutive deconvolved ultrasound image frames. The elegance of the proposed despeckling algorithm is that it addresses the despeckling problem by completely following the signal generation model unlike conventional ad-hoc smoothening or filtering based approaches, and therefore, it is likely to maximally preserve the image features. As deconvolution is a necessary pre-processing step to despeckling, we describe here a $2$-D extension of the SIMO model-based $1$-D deconvolution method. Finally, a complete framework for the generation of high-resolution ultrasound B-mode image has been also established in this paper.

The folding time, $\\tau_F$, depends asymmetrically on $\\delta f_S = f_S - f_m$ and $\\delta f_Q = f_m - f_Q$ where $f_S$ ($f_Q$) is the stretch (quench) force, and $f_m$ is the transition mid-force of the RNA hairpin.

The duration of the plateau increases as $\\lambda =\\tau_Q/\\tau_F$ decreases (where $\\tau_Q$ is the time in which the force is reduced from $f_S$ to $f_Q$).

The success of these flux transport dynamo models is largely dependent upon a single-cell meridional circulation with a deep equatorward component at the base of the Sun\u2019s convection zone. However, recent observations suggest that the meridional flow may in fact be very shallow (confined to the top 10% of the Sun) and more complex than previously thought. Taken together these observations raise serious concerns on the validity of the flux transport paradigm.

Solar-like periodic reversals is recovered even when meridional circulation is altogether absent, however, in this case the solar surface magnetic field dynamics does not extend all the way to the polar regions.

Human programmers routinely tackle the task of writing complex programs by writing sub-programs and then analysing their intermediate results to compose them in appropriate ways. Motivated by this intuition, we present a new synthesis approach that leverages learning to guide a bottom-up search over programs. In particular, we train a model to prioritize compositions of intermediate values during search conditioned on a given set of input-output examples. This is a powerful combination because of several emergent properties: First, in bottom-up search, intermediate programs can be executed, providing semantic information to the neural network. Second, given the concrete values from those executions, we can exploit rich features based on recent work on property signatures. Finally, bottom-up search allows the system substantial flexibility in what order to generate the solution, allowing the synthesizer to build up a program from multiple smaller sub-programs. Overall, our empirical evaluation finds that the combination of learning and bottom-up search is remarkably effective, even with simple supervised learning approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a new data set for synthesis of string transformation programs.'\nauthor:"}

We implement this observation by developing Syn-QG, a set of transparent syntactic rules leveraging universal dependencies, shallow semantic parsing, lexical resources, and custom rules which transform declarative sentences into question-answer pairs. We utilize PropBank argument descriptions and VerbNet state predicates to incorporate shallow semantic content, which helps generate questions of a descriptive nature and produce inferential and semantically richer questions than existing systems. In order to improve syntactic fluency and eliminate grammatically incorrect questions, we employ back-translation over the output of these syntactic rules.

In-situ Raman and transmission/absorption studies have been done to establish the origin of bias induced color change, between a transparent and navy blue color, in the electrochromic device.

Fundamental reason behind colour changes of viologen molecule has been established. In-situ UV-Vis spectra reveals that the navy blue color of the device under biased condition is not due to increase in the transparency corresponding to blue wavelength but due to suppression of the transparency corresponding to the complementary colors.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'Non-local self-similarity in natural images has been well studied as an effective prior in image restoration. However, for single image super-resolution (SISR), most existing deep non-local methods (e.g., non-local neural networks) only exploit similar patches within the same scale of the low-resolution (LR) input image. Consequently, the restoration is limited to using the same-scale information while neglecting potential high-resolution (HR) cues from other scales. In this paper, we explore the cross-scale patch recurrence property of a natural image, i.e., similar patches tend to recur many times across different scales. This is achieved using a novel cross-scale internal graph neural network ([IGNN]{}). Specifically, we dynamically construct a cross-scale graph by searching $k$-nearest neighboring patches in the downsampled LR image for each query patch in the LR image. We then obtain the corresponding $k$ HR neighboring patches in the LR image and aggregate them adaptively in accordance to the edge label of the constructed graph. In this way, the HR information can be passed from $k$ HR neighboring patches to the LR query patch to help it recover more detailed textures. Besides, these internal image-specific LR/HR exemplars are also significant complements to the external information learned from the training dataset."}

The surface shear provides a low energy sink that absorbs most of the momentum from the wind. These produce bounds on the efficiency of wave growth.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'Tomography deals with the reconstruction of objects from their projections, acquired along a range of angles. Discrete tomography is concerned with objects that consist of a small number of materials, which makes it possible to compute accurate reconstructions from highly limited projection data. For cases where the allowed intensity values in the reconstruction are known a priori, the discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) has shown to yield accurate reconstructions from few projections. However, a key limitation is that the benefit of DART diminishes as the number of different materials increases. Many tomographic imaging techniques can simultaneously record tomographic data at multiple *channels*, each corresponding to a different weighting of the materials in the object. Whenever projection data from more than one channel is available, this additional information can potentially be exploited by the reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we present Multi-Channel DART (MC-DART), which deals effectively with multi-channel data. This class of algorithms is a generalization of DART to multiple channels and combines the information for each separate channel-reconstruction in a multi-channel segmentation step. We demonstrate that in a range of simulation experiments, MC-DART is capable of producing more accurate reconstructions compared to single-channel DART.'\nauthor:\n- Math\u00e9"}

Spatial disorder can lead to Anderson localization, inhibiting the spread of quantum walks, putting them at a disadvantage against their diffusively spreading classical counterparts. We find that spatial disorder of the most general type, i.e., position-dependent Haar random coin operators, does not lead to Anderson localization, but to a diffusive spread instead. This is a delocalization, which happens because disorder places the quantum walk to a critical point between different anomalous Floquet-Anderson insulating topological phases. We base this explanation on the relationship of this general quantum walk to a simpler case more studied in the literature, and for which disorder-induced delocalization of a topological origin has been observed. We review topological delocalization for the simpler quantum walk, using time-evolution of the wavefunctions and level spacing statistics.

Furthermore, we present a novel way for calculating CNN based features for different image scales, which performs better than existing methods. We also discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.'\nauthor:\n- |\n    \u00a0\u00a0Christian Bailer$^1$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kiran Varanasi$^{1}$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Didier Stricker$^{1,2}$\\\n    [Christian.Bailer@dfki.de]{}\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Kiran.Varanasi@dfki.de ]{}\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Didier.Stricker@dfki.de]{}\\\n    $^1$German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), $^2$University of Kaiserslautern\\\nbibliography:\n- 'arxiv\\_2.bib'\ntitle: 'CNN-based"}

Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect the geometric constraints in the 3D space.

By designing a loss term that enforces one simple type of geometric constraints, namely, *virtual normal* directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D space, we can considerably improve the depth prediction accuracy. Significantly, the byproduct of this predicted depth being sufficiently accurate is that we are now able to recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface normal directly from the depth, eliminating the necessity of training new sub-models as was previously done.

Chance constraints ensure that the probability of collision is bounded by a predefined risk parameter.

In this paper, we present a grid-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control approach. This approach allows to determine a simple deterministic reformulation of the chance constraints and reduces the computational effort, while considering the stochastic nature of the environment. Within the proposed method, we first divide the environment into a grid and, for each predicted step, assign each cell a probability value, which represents the probability that this cell will be occupied by surrounding vehicles. Then, the probabilistic grid is transformed into a binary grid of admissible and inadmissible cells by applying a threshold, representing a risk parameter. Only cells with an occupancy probability lower than the threshold are admissible for the controlled vehicle. Given the admissible cells, a convex hull is generated, which can then be used for trajectory planning.

Generally, implicit schemes are preferred over the explicit ones for better stability and correctness. The existing implicit schemes are usually iterative and employ a general-purpose solver which may be sub-optimal for a specific class of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a neural solver to learn an optimal iterative scheme for a class of PDEs, in a data-driven fashion. We attain this objective by modifying an iteration of an existing semi-implicit solver using a deep neural network. Further, we prove theoretically that our approach preserves the correctness and convergence guarantees provided by the existing iterative-solvers.

In these, the propagation of the burning front through the exploding white dwarf star proceeds in different modes, and consequently imprints of the explosion model on the nucleosynthetic yields can be expected. The nucleosynthetic characteristics of various explosion mechanisms is explored based on three two-dimensional explosion simulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, a delayed detonation following an approximately spherical ignition of the initial deflagration, and a delayed detonation arising from a highly asymmetric deflagration ignition. Apart from this initial condition, the deflagration stage is treated in a parameter-free approach. The detonation is initiated when the turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. This occurs at densities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ \u2013 relatively low as compared to existing nucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models.

This toughening effect is a consequence of a transition from a brittle to a ductile failure response. Although this transition and the accompanying toughening effect have been demonstrated in hydrogels first, the concept has been proven effective in elastomers and in macroscopic composites as well. This suggests that the transition is not caused by a specific molecular architecture, but rather by a general physical principle related to the mechanical interplay between two interpenetrating networks. Here we employ theory and computer simulations, inspired by this general principle, to investigate how disorder controls the brittle-to-ductile transition both at the macroscopic and the microscopic level. A random spring network model featuring two different spring types, enables us to study the joined effect of initial disorder and network-induced stress heterogeneity on this transition. We reveal that a mechanical force balance gives a good description of the brittle-to-ductile transition. In addition, the inclusion of disorder in the spring model predicts four different failure regimes along the brittle-to-ductile response in agreement with experimental findings.

To address (a), we design the reverse connection, which enables the network to detect objects on multi-levels of CNNs. To deal with (b), we propose the objectness prior to significantly reduce the searching space of objects.

We apply this idea to a system with an anisotropic band mass, as is intrinsically the case in many-valley semiconductors such as AlAs and Si, or in isotropic systems like GaAs in the presence of a tilted magnetic field, which breaks the rotational invariance. We perform exact diagonalization calculations with periodic boundary conditions (torus geometry) for various filling fractions in the lowest, first and second Landau levels. In the lowest Landau level, we demonstrate that FQHE states generally survive the breakdown of rotational invariance by moderate values of the band mass anisotropy.

The proposed inference methodology is based on a particle smoothing (PS) algorithm that depends on three particle filters. Efficient proposal (importance) distributions for the particle filters tailored to the nature of survival data and PEH models are developed using the Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution and linear Bayes theory. The algorithm is applied to both simulated and real data, and the results show that it generates an effective sample size that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than a state-of-the-art MCMC sampler for the same computing time, and scales well in high-dimensional and relatively large data.\n\n    **Key words**: Hazard function, Linear Bayes, particle filter, particle smoothing, piecewise exponential, Survival function.\nauthor:\n- Parfait Munezero\nbibliography:\n- 'Bibliography.bib'\ntitle: Efficient Particle Smoothing for Bayesian Inference in Dynamic Survival Models\n---\n\n\\\n[Parfait.Munezero@stat.su.se]{}\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe standard model for analysing survival data is the proportional hazards model which specifies the hazard function as a product of a baseline hazard (an unknown function of time, $t$) and a relative"}

A strong orbital modulation dominates both continuum and emission line flux variabilities, while line velocity motions are only detected at the rotational frequency. A prominent orbital periodicity is also observed in coordinated optical photometry, where FOAqr was previously found to be spin dominated. The spectral dependence of the main periodicities shows the presence of multi-temperature components in FOAqr and for the first time a hot and a cool component in the rotational modulation. From a comparison with previous UV and optical data obtained in 1990, no spectral variations in the orbital and rotational variabilities are detected, indicating no significant changes in the effects of X-ray illumination but rather a shrinking of the accretion curtain accompained by an increase in size of the thickened part of the accretion disc. These observations, consistent with the recently discovered long term trend in the X-ray pulsation amplitudes, independently confirm a change in the accretion mode in FOAqr, which switched from a disc-fed into a disc-overflow state, likely triggered by mass accretion variations.'\nauthor:\n- 'D. de Martino, R.

Principal component analysis was developed in 1901 and has been a strong contender in this role since, but in the end is an unsupervised method.

While the current star formation rate of post-starbursts is already at the level of early type galaxies, we recently discovered that many have large CO-traced molecular gas reservoirs consistent with normal star forming galaxies. These observations raise the question of why these galaxies have such low star formation rates. Here we present an ALMA search for the denser gas traced by HCN (1\u20130) and HCO$^+$ (1\u20130) in two CO-luminous, quiescent post-starburst galaxies. Intriguingly, we fail to detect either molecule. The upper limits are consistent with the low star formation rates and with early-type galaxies. The HCN/CO luminosity ratio upper limits are low compared to star-forming and even many early type galaxies. This implied low dense gas mass fraction explains the low star formation rates relative to the CO-traced molecular gas and suggests the state of the gas in post-starburst galaxies is unusual, with some mechanism inhibiting its collapse to denser states.

We confirm the result of Onions et al. and show that the typical spin of a subhalo decreases with decreasing mass and increasing proximity to the host halo center. We interpret this as the growing influence of tidal stripping in removing the outer layers, and hence the higher angular momentum particles, of the sub[haloes]{}\u00a0as they move within the host potential. Investigating the redshift dependence of this effect, we find that the typical subhalo spin is smaller with decreasing redshift. This indicates a temporal evolution as expected in the tidal stripping scenario.'\nauthor:\n- 'Yang Wang, Weipeng Lin, Frazer R. Pearce, Hanni Lux, Stuart I.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'We consider the relativistic electron-positron field interacting with itself via the Coulomb potential defined with the physically motivated, positive, density-density quartic interaction. The more usual normal-ordered Hamiltonian differs from the bare Hamiltonian by a quadratic term and, by choosing the normal ordering in a suitable, self-consistent manner, the quadratic term can be seen to be equivalent to a renormalization of the Dirac operator. Formally, this amounts to a Bogolubov-Valatin transformation, but in reality it is non-perturbative, for it leads to an inequivalent, fine-structure dependent representation of the canonical anticommutation relations. This non-perturbative redefinition of the electron/positron states can be interpreted as a mass, wave-function and charge renormalization, among other possibilities, but the main point is that a non-perturbative definition of normal ordering might be a useful starting point for developing a consistent quantum electrodynamics.'\naddress:\n- |\n    Departments of Mathematics and Physics\\\n    Jadwin Hall\\\n    Princeton University\\\n    P.O.B. 708\\\n    Princeton, NJ 08544-0708\\\n    USA\n- |\n    Mathematik I\\\n    Universit\u00e4t Regensburg\\\n    93040 Regensburg\\\n    Germany\nauthor:\n- 'Elliott H.\u00a0Lieb'\n- Heinz Siedentop\ndate: 'March 2, 2000'\ntitle: 'Renormalization of the Regularized Relativistic Electron-Positron Field'\n---\n\nIntroduction\\[S1\\]\n==================\n\nIn relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) the quantized electron-positron field $\\Psi(x)$, which is an operator-valued"}
{"text": "---\nabstract: 'Though the neutrino-driven convection model for the core-collapse explosion mechanism has received strong support in recent years, there are still many uncertainties in the explosion parameters \u2013 such as explosion energy, remnant mass, and end-of-life stellar abundances as initial conditions. Using a broad set of spherically symmetric core-collapse simulations we examine the effects of these key parameters on explosive nucleosynthesis and final explosion yields. Post-bounce temperature and density evolution of ZAMS 15, 20, and 25 solar mass progenitors are post-processed through the Nucleosynthesis Grid (NuGrid) nuclear network to obtain detailed explosive yields. In particular, this study focuses on radio-isotopes that are of particular interest to the next generation of gamma-ray astronomical observations; $\\isotope[43]{K}$, $\\isotope[47]{Ca}$, $\\isotope[44]{Sc}$, $\\isotope[47]{Sc}$, $\\isotope[48]{V}$, $\\isotope[48]{Cr}$, $\\isotope[51]{Cr}$, $\\isotope[52]{Mn}$, $\\isotope[59]{Fe}$, $\\isotope[56]{Co}$, $\\isotope[57]{Co}$, and $\\isotope[57]{Ni}$. These nuclides may be key in advancing our understanding of the inner workings of core-collapse supernovae by probing the parameters of the explosion engine.

{"text": "---\nabstract: 'The question of whether a singularity can form in an initially regular flow, described by the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, is a fundamental problem in mathematical physics. The NS regularity problem is super-critical, i.e., there is a \u2018scaling gap\u2019 between what can be established by mathematical analysis and what is needed to rule out a singularity. A recently introduced mathematical framework\u2013based on a suitably defined \u2018scale of sparseness\u2019 of the regions of intense vorticity\u2013brought the first scaling reduction of the NS super-criticality since the 1960s. Here, we put this framework to the first numerical test using a spatially highly resolved computational simulation performed near a \u2018burst\u2019 of the vorticity magnitude. The results confirm that the scale is well suited to detect the onset of dissipation and provide strong numerical evidence that ongoing mathematical efforts may succeed in closing the scaling gap.'\nauthor:\n- Janet Rafner\n- Zoran Gruji\u0107\n- Christian Bach\n- Jakob Andreas B\u00e6rentzen\n- Bo Gervang\n- Ruo Jia\n- Scott Leinweber\n- Marek Misztal\n- Jacob Sherson\ntitle: ' Geometry of turbulent dissipation and the Navier-Stokes regularity problem '\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nHumans have been fascinated with the geometry of fluid flows for centuries."}
