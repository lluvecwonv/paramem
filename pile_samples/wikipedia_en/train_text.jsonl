The word \"office\" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an adjective, the term \"office\" may refer to business-related tasks. In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair. An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.

Metro, the metropolitan area's regional government, has a regional master plan in which transit-oriented development plays a major role.  This approach, part of the new urbanism, promotes mixed-use and high-density development around light rail stops and transit centers, and the investment of the metropolitan area's share of federal tax dollars into multiple modes of transportation.

Haribhadra's commentary on the Abhisamayalankara was one of the most influential of the twenty-one Indian commentaries on that text, perhaps because of its author's status as Shantarakshita's student.

Haribhadra claims, that Abhisamayalamkara chapter 8 is describing Buddhahood through four kayas: svabhavikakaya, [jnana]dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya.

In Sassanid Empire, Borujerd was a small town and region neighboring Nahavand. Gaining more attention during Great Seljuq Empire in the 9th and 10th centuries, Borujerd stood as an industrial, commercial and strategic city in Zagros Mountains until the 20th century. In its golden ages, Borujerd was selected as the state capital of Lorestan and Khuzestan region during Qajar dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nToday, Borujerd is the second largest city of Lorestan; hence, the major industrial, tourist and cultural center of the region. The city has kept its old architecture and lifestyle mostly through mosques, bazaars and houses built in the Qajar era.

{"text": "Cask breather\n\nA cask breather (sometimes called a cask aspirator) is a type of demand valve used to serve draught beer. The cask breather enables the empty space created when beer is drawn from a beer cask to be filled with carbon dioxide from an external source.

The airlines typically use service counters found at airports. The check-in is normally handled by an airline itself or a handling agent working on behalf of an airline. Passengers usually hand over any baggage that they do not wish or are not allowed to carry in to the aircraft's cabin and receive a boarding pass before they can proceed to board their aircraft.\n\nCheck-in is usually the first procedure for a passenger when arriving at an airport, as airline regulations require passengers to check in by certain times prior to the departure of a flight. This duration spans from 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the destination and airline (with self check in, this can be expanded to 24 hours, if checking in by online processes).  During this process, the passenger has the ability to ask for special accommodations such as seating preferences, inquire about flight or destination information, accumulate frequent flyer program miles, or pay for upgrades.

The brook is approximately  long and is a tributary of the Bristol Avon. Much of its course is through the eastern suburbs of Bristol, although it remains outside the city boundaries. Tributaries include the Warmley Brook and an unnamed tributary from Bridgeyate.\n\nThe stream has provided power for watermills and battery mills in the past and some mill buildings still survive. Wildlife is supported by nature reserves through which the Siston Brook runs. Flooding has caused problems in the past, but modern measures to alleviate this include an attenuation reservoir and proposals to reinstate historic weirs and sluices. The name Siston is believed to derive from Anglo-Saxon, meaning Sige's Farmstead.\n\nCourse\nThe source of Siston Brook is two springs which flow out of a ridge just north of the village of Siston.

{"text": "Glauber\u2013Sudarshan P representation\n\nThe Sudarshan-Glauber P representation is a suggested way of writing down the phase space distribution of a quantum system in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics.  The P representation is the quasiprobability distribution in which observables are expressed in normal order.

Macaulay described the song as \"a loyal ode, which had lately been written by Durfey, and which, though like all Durfey's writings, utterly contemptible, was, at that time, almost as popular as Lillibullero became a few years later.\" He also recorded that the song was sung in a triumphal march by the newly elected members and \"a long train of knights and squires,\" after an unpopular and controversial Tory electoral victory in Cheshire in 1685.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Thomas Babington Macaulay, History of England, Vol. I, Chapter IV"}

Along with Bellow's second novel The Victim, it is considered his \"apprentice\" work.\n\nReception\nSome critics, including Edmund Wilson and Kenneth Fearing, deplored the novel's lack of a definite plot, but praised Bellow's depiction of what they saw as the characteristic features of the generation of American intellectuals raised during the Great Depression. Dangling Man can be seen as a superfluous man narrative, raising interesting parallels with Turgenev's The Diary of a Superfluous Man and exploring the 19th-century Russian literary concept through a contemporary American experience.\n\nExternal links\n Summary of Dangling Man on saulbellow.org\n\nCategory:Novels by Saul Bellow\nCategory:1944 American novels\nCategory:Debut novels\nCategory:Novels set in Chicago\nCategory:Vanguard Press books"}

Herbert discusses the most common interpretations of quantum mechanics and their consequences in turn, highlighting the conceptual advantages and drawbacks of each.\n\nSynopsis\n\nBackground\nFollowing a brief summary of the experimental crises (such as the ultraviolet catastrophe) which motivated quantum theory, Herbert identifies four major formulations of quantum theory: Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics, Paul Dirac's transformation theory, and Richard Feynman's sum-over-histories formulation.\n\nIn introducing quantum objects (which he dubs \"quons\"), Herbert describes how quantum properties inhere in a wave function, which serves as a proxy for the measurement of these properties. He likens the quantum measurement process to mathematically treating the wave function as a summation of waveforms of a particular family, with various families corresponding to particular properties. The bandwidth of the spectrum of these waveforms represents the uncertainty in the quantum measurement. Herbert shows that for pairs of conjugate variables, such as"}

The only vocal track, 'Gone Hollywood', co-written by Lenny White, has good keyboard textures and plaintive vocals from Lisa Fischer and blistering guitar solos from Steve Kahn. [...] While many might be put off by the pure 1980s production values of '3AM' and 'Rousseau', luckily, they have compelling arrangements to ward off boredom. The album's best song, 'Rain', is a methodical and pretty track that is an essential for devotees of the often-maligned late-1980s jazz-pop era.

This seemingly Gondwana-derived distribution belies the fact that the group once had a cosmopolitan distribution; fossils which can be assigned to the Phreatoicidea are the oldest isopod fossils, and are found throughout the world. In the intervening 325 million years, phreatoicideans have changed little, and are thus considered living fossils.\n\nThe first Australian phreatoicidean was described by Charles Chilton in 1891.

{"text": "Malter effect\n\nThe Malter effect is named after Louis Malter, who first described the effect. Following exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., electrons, ions, X-rays, extreme ultraviolet, vacuum ultraviolet), secondary electron emission from the surface of a thin insulating layer results in the establishment of a positive charge on the surface. This positive charge produces a high electric field in the insulator, resulting in the emission of electrons through the surface. This tends to pull more electrons from further beneath the surface. Eventually the sample replenishes the lost electrons, by picking up the collected secondary electrons through the ground loop.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n L. Malter, Phys.

{"text": "Local average treatment effect\n\nThe local average treatment effect (LATE), also known as the complier average causal effect (CACE), was first introduced into the econometrics literature by Guido W. Imbens and Joshua D. Angrist in 1994. It is the treatment effect for the subset of the sample that takes the treatment if and only if they were assigned to the treatment, otherwise known as the compliers. It is not to be confused with the average treatment effect (ATE), which is the average subject-level treatment effect; the LATE is only the ATE among the compliers. The LATE can be estimated by a ratio of the estimated intent-to-treat effect and the estimated proportion of compliers, or alternatively through an instrumental variable estimator. Since the LATE may not be equivalent to the ATE, we should be cautious of extrapolation.\n\nGeneral definition \nThe ATE is the difference between the expected value of the treatment group and the expected value of the control group.

American Architect Robert B. Sobel of Emery Roth & Sons, with engineer and fellow American Nat W. Krahl of Rice University, created a concept for a 500-story building made from 200-foot sided bundled triangular tubes.  Sobel had theorized the construction of a 500-story building as early as 1974.\n\nAccording to Emery Roth & Sons, the project showed that the technology and materials existed to build a 500-story (or taller) building, if someone wished to do so.  Since its first inception, it has remained one of the tallest buildings ever fully envisioned, and would have taken up 16 city blocks of 250x250 feet if constructed.

Only a single example was built, the Gloster Gladiator being selected instead to fulfill the requirement to which it was designed.\n\nDesign and development\nIn 1930 the British Air Ministry circulated a draft version of Specification F.7/30 for a heavily armed day and night fighter around likely manufacturers. The new fighter was to have a speed of at least 250\u00a0mph (400\u00a0km/h) and a good climb rate.  As it was expected that the high speeds of both the fighter and its prospective targets would only allow short bursts of fire to hit the target, an armament of four Vickers machine guns was required, double that of earlier fighters. Although not a requirement of the specification, the Air Ministry encouraged the use of the new steam-cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine.\n\nTo meet this requirement, Hawker Aircraft submitted two designs, one a monoplane and the other a biplane, but both were rejected by the Air Ministry when contracts were awarded for prototypes in 1932, orders going to Blackburn Aircraft (for its F.3) and Westland Aircraft (the Westland F.7/30).

They are typically made up of a thick steel wire with large coils; compression springs need to be able to handle very large loads while being able to return to their natural extended position. Compression springs store potential energy when they are compressed (length of spring decreases), and exert kinetic energy when released. Compression garter springs use this principle to withstand forces acting on it from outside. They may be placed inside a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape.

{"text": "Iridoid\n\nIridoids are a type of monoterpenoids in the general form of cyclopentanopyran, found in a wide variety of plants and some animals.  They are biosynthetically derived from 8-oxogeranial.  Iridoids are typically found in plants as glycosides, most often bound to glucose.\n\nThe chemical structure is exemplified by iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical produced by the genus Iridomyrmex, for which iridoids are named.  Structurally, they are bicyclic cis-fused cyclopentane-pyrans.  Cleavage of a bond in the cyclopentane ring gives rise to a subclass known as secoiridoids, such as oleuropein and amarogentin.\n\nOccurrence\n\nThe iridoids produced by plants act primarily as a defense against herbivores or against infection by microorganisms. The variable checkerspot butterfly also contains iridoids obtained through its diet which act as a defense against avian predators. To humans and other mammals, iridoids are often characterized by a deterrent bitter taste.\n\nAucubin and catalpol are two of the most common iridoids in the plant kingdom.

The vicar of Hatton was responsible for the religious life of the hospital. Nevertheless, it was, in the early days, a reasonably hard place to be treated by modern standards.

Arab Muslim ships sailed from Madagascar to China, often going in and out of Burma. Arab travellers visited the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal south of Burma.  The Muslims arrived in Burma's Ayeyarwady River delta, on the Tanintharyi coast and in Rakhine in the 9th century, prior to the establishment of the first Burmese empire in 1055 AD by King Anawrahta of Bagan. The sea posts of Burma such as Kyaukpyu, Bassein, Syriam, Martaban, Mergui, etc. are rife with the legendary accounts of early shipwrecks in their neighbourhood: of Kular shipwrecked sailors, traders and soldiers.

In Gloucestershire the dripping is allowed to form a toffee-like layer at the base of the cake.

It owes its name, meaning \"seven rivers\" (literally \"seven waters\") in Kazakh and Persian, to the rivers which flow from the south-east into Lake Balkhash.\n\nWhen the region was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century, it became known in Russian (and, to an extent, in European languages) as Semirechye (), which is a Russian calque of the Kazakh \"Zhetysu\".

That this phenomenon happens for certain broadly defined classes of lattices inside semisimple groups was the discovery of Grigory Margulis, who proved some fundamental results in this direction.\n\nThere is more than one result that goes by the name of Margulis superrigidity.

Suppose \u0393 is an irreducible lattice in G. For a local field F and \u03c1 a linear representation of the lattice \u0393 of the Lie group, into GLn (F), assume the image \u03c1(\u0393) is not relatively compact (in the topology arising from F) and such that its closure in the Zariski topology is connected.

{"text": "Bacterial wilt\n\nBacterial wilt is a cucurbit disease caused by the pathogen Erwinia tracheiphila, a gram-negative bacterium. Cucumber and muskmelon plants are most susceptible, but squash, pumpkins, and gourds may also become infected.\n\nDisease transmission \nE. tracheiphila is spread between plants by two species of insect vectors, striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma Vittatum) and spotted cucumber beetles (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). The beetles acquire E. tracheiphila by feeding on infected plants, then carry the bacteria in their digestive tracts. The disease may be spread to susceptible plants through feeding wounds, by way of infected mouthparts or frass. The bacteria is capable of overwintering in the gut of its insect vectors.\n\nSymptoms and diagnosis \nBacterial wilt is a disease of the vascular tissue. When a plant is infected, E. tracheiphila multiplies within the xylem, eventually causing mechanical blockage of the water transport system. The first sign of infection, which appears about five days after acquisition, is the wilting of individual leaves on a single stem. However, the disease will soon spread down the runner and then infect the whole plant, causing it to shrivel and die. \nThere is a diagnostic test for bacterial wilt that can be done in the field.

Despite the seemingly sincere, intelligent, even charming external presentation, internally the psychopathic person does not have the ability to experience genuine emotions.

There are competing explanations for the origin of the phrase \"left shift,\" including the left-most button arrangement of early cell sorting machines and a 1920s publication by Josef Arneth, containing a graph in which immature neutrophils, with fewer segments, shifted the median left.\n\nMorphology\nIt is usually noted on microscopic examination of a blood smear.

In this family, the winged species can fly at least reasonably well, though others with vestigial or no wings are flightless and highly apomorphic. As usual in their superfamily Hippoboscoidea, most of the larval development takes place within the mother's body, and pupation occurs almost immediately.\n\nThe sheep ked, Melophagus ovinus, is a wingless, reddish-brown fly that parasitizes sheep.  The Neotropical deer ked, Lipoptena mazamae, is a common ectoparasite of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the southeastern United States. Both winged and wingless forms may be seen. A common winged species is Hippobosca equina, called \"the louse fly\" among riders.  Species in other genera are found on birds; for example, Ornithomya bequaerti has been collected from birds in Alaska. Two species of the Hippoboscidae \u2013 Ornithoica (Ornithoica) podargi and Ornithomya fuscipennis are also common parasites of the tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) of Australia.\n\nPseudolynchia canariensis is commonly found on pigeons and doves, and can serve as the vector of \"pigeon malaria\" (Haemoproteus columbae).

Rigid airships always needed to be based in airship hangars because weathering was a serious risk.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly hangars \n\nThe first real airship hangar was built as Hangar \u201cY\u201d at Chalais-Meudon near Paris in 1879 where the engineers Charles Renard and Arthur Constantin Krebs constructed their first airship \u201cLa France\u201d.\nHangar \u201cY\u201d is one of the few remaining airship hangars in Europe.\n\nThe construction of the first operational rigid airship LZ1 by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin started in 1899 in a floating hangar on Lake Constance at Manzell today part of Friedrichshafen. The floating hangar turned into the direction of the wind  on its own and so it was easier to move the airship into the hangar exactly against the wind.\n\nFor the same reason later rotating hangars were built at Biesdorf (today part of Berlin) and at the Nordholz Airbase, to the south of Cuxhaven in Germany.\nAlready before the First World War there were transportable tent constructions as hangars for smaller airships. They were quite common in the US at fairgrounds or exhibitions. The American Melvin Vaniman constructed big tent"}

It prohibited the registration of any new 'mixed' unions and imposed racially separate branches and all-white executive committees on existing 'mixed' unions. It prohibited strikes in 'essential industries' for both black and white workers, and banned political affiliations for unions. Clause 77 legalized the reservation of skilled jobs to white workers, as the Bantu Building Workers Act of 1951 had done in the construction trade, 'to ensure that they will not be exploited by the lower standard of living of any other race'.\n\nThe primary objective of the Industrial Conciliation Act was to separate the trade union movements along racial lines, with the aim of weakening them.

As she hardly speaks English and he speaks no Russian, they talk in French, a language in which neither is confident. Much of their communication is therefore non-verbal and the two frequently misunderstand each other. \nTheir days are spent driving and walking around the empty desert, sometimes naked. They make love, they fight, or just pass time. The camera contrasts the vastness, timelessness and emptiness of the landscape with the two small humans. Yet, as well as natural beauty, the desert contains menace. Stopped by a pick-up full of rednecks, David is beaten and raped while Katia is stripped and forced to watch.

{"text": "Guild socialism\n\nGuild socialism is a political movement advocating workers' control of industry through the medium of trade-related guilds \"in an implied contractual relationship with the public\". It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly associated with G. D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of William Morris.\n\nHistory and development \n\nGuild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of craftsmen and other skilled workers which had existed in England in the Middle Ages. In 1906, Arthur Penty published Restoration of the Gild System in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal The New Age became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty.\n\nIn 1914, S. G. Hobson, a leading contributor to The New Age, published National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Guilds, unlike the existing trade unions, would"}

The pre-determined overhead rate is calculated before the period begins. The first step is to estimate the amount of the activity base that will be required to support operations in the upcoming period. The second step is to estimate the total manufacturing cost at that level of activity.

Alberto Santos-Dumont helped fund experimentation on designs in France. Multiple examples were built, demonstrated, crashed, improved and rebuilt owing to conflicting and different names for the various versions. Anticipating success with the counter-rotating mechanism, Pescara patented a design with a streamlined fuselage with one set of rotors above, and one below the fuselage.\n\nThe model three was the first example to use control mechanisms as modern helicopters. The helicopter is based around a central shaft with counter-rotating rotors. Each rotor was doubled into a biplane arrangement with cable supports. It used a cyclic stick for forward and lateral control with rotor warping, and wheel for yaw anti-torque control. The main rotor shaft was able to tilt slightly for forward control. The rotors were also capable of autorotation in case of engine failure.\n\nOperational history\nIn September 1923, a 1\u00a0km flight attempt was nearly completed, before the vehicle crashed.

It is known by the common names yellow-patched lieutenant, rufous-backed marsh hawk, and blue dasher. It is native to much of eastern Asia, from India to Japan to Indonesia.\n\nDescription and habitat\nThe male of the species is 33 to 35 millimeters long and has a hindwing 24 to 27 millimeters long. It is powder blue with light brown sides and a dark tip to the abdomen. Wings are hyaline, with tinted burnt-brown base, fading to amber. The female is brownish yellow in color with darker markings along the dorsal abdomen. Its wings lack the yellow tinge. This species can be easily distinguished from other species in this genus by its larger size, characteristic colour of the thorax, and bases of wings.\n\nThis species is found in many types of wet habitat, including brackish and disturbed waters. The males are seen more often, due to their territorial behavior. Females oviposit by \"flicking\" an egg mass out of the water into rocks and vegetation nearby.\n\nSee also \n List of odonates of Sri Lanka\n List of odonates of India\n List of odonata of Kerala\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Libellulidae\nCategory:Odonata"}

Of all the other planets in the Solar System, it is the one nearest to Earth and most like it in terms of mass, but has no magnetic field or recognizable plate tectonic system. Much of the ground surface is exposed volcanic bedrock, some with thin and patchy layers of soil covering, in marked contrast with Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Some impact craters are present, but Venus is similar to Earth in that there are many fewer craters than on the other rocky planets that are largely covered by them. \n\nThis is due in part to the thickness of the Venusian atmosphere disrupting small impactors before they strike the ground, but the paucity of large craters may be due to volcanic re-surfacing, possibly of a catastrophic nature. Volcanism appears to be the dominant agent of geological change on Venus. Some of the volcanic landforms appear to be unique to the planet.

{"text": "Heavy Rydberg system\n\nA heavy Rydberg system consists of a weakly bound positive and negative ion orbiting their common centre of mass. Such systems share many properties with the conventional Rydberg atom and consequently are sometimes referred to as heavy Rydberg atoms.  While such a system is a type of ionically bound molecule, it should not be confused with a molecular Rydberg state, which is simply a molecule with one or more highly excited electrons.\n\nThe peculiar properties of the Rydberg atom come from the large charge separation and the resulting hydrogenic potential. The extremely large separation between the two components of a heavy Rydberg system results in an almost perfect 1/r hydrogenic potential seen by each ion. The positive ion can be viewed as analogous to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, with the negative ion playing the role of the electron.\n\nSpecies \n\nThe most commonly studied system to date is the  system, consisting of a proton bound with a  ion.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, in Basel, Switzerland. The resulting patent CH532261 was licensed worldwide to electronics and watch industries and thus initiated a paradigm change towards flat panel field effect liquid crystal (LC) displays.\n \nIn the early 1970s, Martin Schadt started to investigate correlations between liquid crystal molecular structures, material properties, electro-optical effects and display performance to obtain criteria for novel, effect-specific liquid crystal materials for TN- and subsequent field-effect applications. His interdisciplinary approach involving physics and chemistry became the basis for modern industrial LC-materials research and led to the discovery and production of numerous new functional molecules and new electro-optical effects. In 1970, shortly after the invention of the TN-effect, he developed the first commercial room temperature nematic liquid crystal mixture with positive dielectric anisotropy, used in the displays of the first Japanese digital TN-LCD watches.

Narrative logic is a tool through which the audience may infer actions, events, intentions, thoughts, beliefs, values, and feelings of characters and narrators, or otherwise elucidate details not included in the narrative.  For example, if a character is in Paris in one scene and in Nice the next, the audience can infer that she traveled, and later references to that travel will not be illogical or unexplainable simply because the trip was not explicitly described. In the same way, if a gun is shown in the drawer of a character's desk, the audience can infer that the gun will be or has been used in some way relevant to the plot.  Authors will often play with conventional patterns of narrative logic by attempting to plant \"false leads\" or to hide important clues, leading audiences to improper conclusions or even to doubt their sense of what is really happening.\n\nIt is necessary to build a logical argument based upon the content of a narrative, using its events and rhetoric as evidence to infer other elements necessary to produce"}

The Tacoma Building was demolished in 1929 to be replaced by One North LaSalle.\n\nA pioneering building of the Chicago School, it uses a framework of iron and steel constructed by George A. Fuller with, for the first time, all its members fixed together by rivets. While internally still supported by load-bearing walls, the two facades towards LaSalle Street and Madison Street are true curtain walls. With this, Holabird & Roche's structure went beyond William LeBaron Jenney's solution for his Home Insurance Building.\n\nAfter investigating the lost Chicago landmark, the National Association of Building Owners and Managers diagnosed the cause of its obsolescence to be the building's inefficient layout.\n\nSee also\n Early skyscrapers\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \nBlaser, Werner.
