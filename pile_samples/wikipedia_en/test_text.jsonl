It is one of the most expensive private girls' schools in South Africa.\n\nHistory \n\nDSG is an Anglican school that was founded in 1874 by the Rt Revd Nathaniel Merriman, Bishop of Grahamstown for the Diocese of Grahamstown. The school is located in Worcester St, at the bottom of the West Hill of Grahamstown and is adjacent to St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University. Formerly, the girls were allowed little or no contact at all with their brother school, St. Andrew's College.

{"text": "ArhGAP11B and human encephalisation\n\nARHGAP11B is a human-specific gene which appeared after the divergence from chimpanzees. It amplifies basal progenitors, controls neural progenitor proliferation and can cause neocortex folding. It is capable of causing neocortex folding in mice. This likely reflects a role for ARHGAP11B in development and evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex, a conclusion consistent with the finding that the gene duplication that created ARHGAP11B occurred on the human lineage after the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage but before the divergence from Neanderthals.\n\nStructure\nARHGAP11B encodes 267 amino-acids and is a truncated version of ARHGAP11A. ARHGAP11B arose on the human evolutionary lineage after the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage by partial duplication of ARHGAP11A, which is found throughout the animal kingdom and encodes a Rho GTPase-activating-protein (RhoGAP domain). ARHGAP11B exists not only in present-day humans but also in Neandertals and Denisovans. ARHGAP11B comprises most of the GAP-domain (until lysine-220) followed by a novel C-terminal sequence but lacking the C-terminal 756 amino acids of ARHGAP11A.\n\nActivity\nIn contrast to full-length ARHGAP11A and ARHGAP11A 1-250, ARHGAP11B, like ARHGAP11A1-220, did not exhibit RhoGAP activity in a RhoA/Rho-kinase\u2013based cell transfection assay.

{"text": "Gene desert\n\nGene deserts are regions of the genome that are devoid of protein-coding genes. Gene deserts constitute an estimated 25% of the entire genome, leading to the recent interest in their true functions. Originally believed to contain inessential and \u201cjunk\u201d DNA due to their inability to create proteins, gene deserts have since been linked to several vital regulatory functions, including distal enhancing and conservatory inheritance. Thus, an increasing number of risks that lead to several major diseases, including a handful of cancers, have been attributed to irregularities found in gene deserts. One of the most notable examples is the 8q24 gene region, which, when affected by certain single nucleotide polymorphisms, lead to a myriad of diseases. The major identifying factors of gene deserts lay in their low GpC content and their relatively high levels of repeats, which are not observed in coding regions. Recent studies have even further categorized gene deserts into variable and stable forms; regions are categorized based on their behavior through recombination and their genetic contents. Although current knowledge of gene deserts is rather limited, ongoing research and improved techniques are beginning to open the doors for exploration on the various important effects of these noncoding"}

Goodrich Company, the original developer of the CPVC resin.\n\nProduction process\nChlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) is PVC that has been chlorinated via a free radical chlorination reaction. This reaction is typically initiated by application of thermal or UV energy utilizing various approaches. In the process, chlorine gas is decomposed into free radical chlorine which is then reacted with PVC in a post-production step, essentially replacing a portion of the hydrogen in the PVC with chlorine.\n\nDepending on the method, a varying amount of chlorine is introduced into the"}
{"text": "Ukrainian oligarchs\n\nThe Ukrainian oligarchs are a group of business oligarchs that emerged on the economic and political scene of Ukraine following the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum. This period saw Ukraine transitioning to a market economy with the rapid privatization of state-owned assets. These developments mirrored those of neighboring Post-Soviet states following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The influence of Ukrainian oligarchs on domestic and regional politics, and in particular their links to Russia, have been the source of criticism from pro-western sources critical of Ukraines lack of political reform, or action against corruption.\n\nIn 2008, the combined wealth of Ukraine's 50 richest oligarchs was equal to 85% of Ukraine's GDP. In November 2013 this number was 45% (of GDP). By 2015, due to the Ukrainian crisis, the total net worth of the five richest and most influential Ukrainians (Rinat Akhmetov, Viktor Pinchuk, Ihor Kolomoyskyi, Henadiy Boholyubov and Yuriy Kosiuk) had dropped from $21.6 billion in 2014 to $11.85 billion in June 2015.

These considerations led to a glider with wings of high aspect ratio and high wing loading.  The T.G.N.1 had an aspect ratio of 21.8 and wing loading of 8.0\u00a0lb/ft2 (39\u00a0kg/m2), compared with 9.9 and 2.8\u00a0lb/ft2 (13.7\u00a0kg/m2) for the roughly contemporary Slingsby Falcon (Schleicher Falke).\n\nThe short-span, narrow mean chord (16\u00a0in or 406\u00a0mm) cantilever wing was built of wood like the rest of the T.G.N.1.  It had three parts, two plywood-skinned lifting sections each 15\u00a0ft (4.57\u00a0m) long joined by a 3\u00a0ft (910\u00a0mm) centre section.

{"text": "Kollikodon\n\nKollikodon ritchiei is an australosphenidan species, often classified as a monotreme but more recently recovered as an outgroup. It is known only from an opalised dentary fragment, with one premolar and two molars in situ. The fossil was found in the Griman Creek Formation at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia, as was Steropodon.\n\nKollikodon lived in the lower Cretaceous period, during the middle Albian age (113-101 million years ago).\n\nLike Steropodon, Kollikodon was a relatively large mammal for the Mesozoic. The molars have a length of around 5.5\u00a0mm and a width of between about 4 and 6\u00a0mm (Clemens et al., 2003). Based upon these data, the potential body length could be up to a metre. Assuming the accuracy of such a guess, Kollikodon would be a contender for the largest Mesozoic mammal known, along with other possible giants such as Repenomamus, Schowalteria, and Bubodens.\n\nAside from its size, it is difficult to say what Kollikodon looked like.

{"text": "Beta bulge\n\nA beta bulge can be described as a localized disruption of the regular hydrogen bonding of beta sheet by inserting extra residues into one or both hydrogen bonded \u03b2-strands.\n\nTypes\n\u03b2-bulges can be grouped according to their length of the disruption, the number of residues inserted into each strand, whether the disrupted \u03b2-strands are parallel or antiparallel and by their dihedral angles (which controls the placement of their side chains). Two types occur commonly. One, the classic beta bulge, occurs within, or at the edge of, antiparallel beta-sheet; the first residue at the outwards bulge typically has the \u03b1R, rather than the normal \u03b2, conformation.\n\nThe other type is the beta bulge loop (also named type G1 \u03b2-bulge), often occurs in association with an antiparallel sheet, but also in other situations. One residue has the \u03b1L conformation and is part of a beta turn or alpha turn, such that the motif sometimes forms the loop of a beta hairpin.\n\nEffects on structure\nAt the level of the backbone structure, classic \u03b2-bulges can cause a simple aneurysm of the \u03b2-sheet, e.g., the bulge in the long \u03b2-hairpin of ribonuclease A (residues 88-91).

{"text": "Fixed-field alternating gradient accelerator\n\nA Fixed-Field alternating gradient Accelerator (FFA) is a circular particle accelerator concept on which development was started in the early 50s, and that can be characterized by its time-independent magnetic fields (fixed-field, like in a cyclotron) and the use of strong focusing (alternating gradient, like in a synchrotron). Thus, FFA accelerators combine the cyclotron's advantage of continuous, unpulsed operation, with the synchrotron's relatively inexpensive small magnet ring, of narrow bore.\n\nAlthough the development of FFAs had not been pursued for over a decade starting from 1967, interest has been revived since the mid-1980s for usage in neutron spallation sources, as a driver for muon colliders   and to accelerate muons in a  neutrino factory since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe revival in FFA research has been particularly strong in Japan with the construction of several rings. This resurgence has been prompted in part by advances in RF cavities and in magnet design.\n\nWe note that the acronym for Fixed-Field alternating gradient Accelerator has recently changed from FFAG to FFA.

{"text": "Pappotherium\n\nPappotherium is an extinct genus of mammals from the Albian (early Cretaceous) of Texas, US, known from a fossilized maxilla fragment bearing two tribosphenic molars, discovered within the Glen Rose Formation near Decatur, Wise County, Texas.\n\nThe fossil was discovered by Bob H. Slaughter within some deposits dating back to 112.6 \u2013 109 million years ago. On the basis of the morphology of the molars' cusps, in 1965 Slaughter established the new genus Pappotherium and the new species P. pattersoni; he also created an apposite family, Pappotheriidae. Both this family and the genus are nowadays still monotypic.\n\nSlaughter argued that Pappotherium should have been a basal form close to the metatherian-eutherian divergence point; this mammal likely was an arboreal insectivore.\n\nEtymologically speaking, the name Pappotherium is a compound of the Latin words pappus (from ancient Greek \u03c0\u03ac\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, p\u00e1ppos, \u201cgrandfather\u201d) and therium (from ancient Greek \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, th\u0113r\u00edon, \u201cbeast\u201d, a common suffix among extinct mammals), with the full meaning of \u201cmammal-grandfather\u201d.\n\nThe second part of the unique species' name, pattersoni, was instead chosen in honor of the American paleontologist Bryan Patterson.\n\nMore recently, it has been recovered as a possible deltatheroidean.

Tribes of the Yuggera language group inhabited the whole area, with the tribe inhabiting the mainland coastal strip stretching from Redland Bay to the mouth of the Brisbane River being called the Koobenpul.\n\nIt is considered that the first Europeans to travel through Wellington Point were three shipwrecked timber getters, Pamphlett, Finnegan and Parsons in 1823.\n\nWellington Point was named by surveyors Robert Dixon and James Warner in 1842"}

This painting is oil on canvas painted in the style of divisionism. Divisionism refers to the actual division of colors by creating separated brush strokes as opposed to smooth, solid lines. The painting contains three figures, one being Boccioni\u2019s mother Cecilia on the left, another being his sister, Amelia on the right, and the third being Ines, his lover, in the center.\n\nTransition\nArt teacher and portraitist Giacomo Balla introduced Boccioni to the painting styles of divisionism. According to the Deutsche Bank and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, divisionism, which emerged in Northern Italy in the late 1880s, was the \u201cpainting method [that] was characterized by the juxtaposition of strokes of pigment to create the visual effect of intense single colors\u201d. These individual strokes vary over the surface of the canvas, resembling \u201cfilament-like\u201d threads.  Divisionists also believed in increased luminosity in their paintings. As Boccioni was making the transition from divisionism to futurism, he struggled with changing his pre-futuristic subjects of art.

{"text": "Argiletum\n\nThe Argiletum () was the main route approaching the Forum Romanum from the northeast in the ancient city of Rome. It connected the Forum with the Subura district of the city. Paths that were found in the Alta Semita and the domus on the Oppian and Caelian hills converged onto the Argiletum, making it a principal node of public space particularly during the Flavian rule.\n\nDevelopment \nVarro claimed that the etymology of the term argiletum was connected with the name of a Greek scoundrel. As it originally passed between Comitium and Basilica Pauli, the Argiletum was eventually absorbed by the construction of the imperial fora from the time of Julius Caesar onwards.  Given this encroachment, the limits of the Argiletum were defined differently in various periods. One of the landmarks excavated in the area was a quadrifrons, which was located at the juncture of the Forum Romanum, Argiletum, and Forum of Caesar. It is suggested that a second arch or a temple was also constructed somewhere on the Argiletum, possibly close to the templum iani in the Forum.\n\nBy the time of Martial (died ca 103 CE) the Argiletum had become a seedy district filled with taverns and brothels."}

Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of \"acquir[ing] a sense of self-worth by denying one's past\". The Piano Lesson received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nA Romare Bearden painting, The Piano Lesson, inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African-American history, paralleling Troy in earlier Fences.

What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: \"What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use?\"\n\nSet in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano, which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor.

{"text": "Renovascular hypertension\n\nRenovascular hypertension is a condition in which high blood pressure is caused by the kidneys' hormonal response to narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys. When functioning properly this hormonal axis regulates blood pressure. Due to low local blood flow, the kidneys mistakenly increase blood pressure of the entire circulatory system.

In a charter of AD 958 King Edgar the Peaceful granted at Ducklington to his Minister, Eanulf. The toponym \"Ducklington\" may originate from \"Ducel's Farm\" or \"the farm of the sons of Docca\", but it is locally thought to have originated from the central duck pond, where many ducks and ducklings have lived for centuries.

{"text": "In a German Pension\n\nIn a German Pension is a 1911 collection of short stories by the writer Katherine Mansfield; her first published collection. All but three of the stories were originally published in The New Age edited by A. R. Orage; the first to appear was \"The Child-Who-Was-Tired\". The last three were first published in this collection, and Alpers thinks that two (The Swing of the Pendulum and The Blaze) were probably rejected by Orage for The New Age.\n\nThe collection was originally published in December 1911 by Stephen Swift & Co Ltd; the imprint of Charles Granville the publisher of Rhythm. The first impression of probably 500 copies was followed by two more impressions of 500 copies in January and in May or June 1912. In early October 1912 Granville absconded to Algiers, and his firm was liquidated. A story that copies for America went down with the Titanic in April 1912 is probably not true. \n\nMansfield refused permission for a reprint of the collection in 1920, both as they were juvenilia and they could contribute to post-war jingoism.

If the tube were straight, the liquid would immediately fly out one end or the other of the tube as it began to spin. By bending the ends of the tube back towards the center of rotation, a shift of the liquid away from center will result in the water level in one end of the tube rising and thus increasing the pressure in that end of the tube, and consequently returning the liquid to the center of the tube. By measuring the rotational speed and the distance from the center of rotation to the liquid level in the bent ends of the tube, the pressure reduction inside the tube can be calculated.\n\nNegative pressures, (i.e. less than zero absolute pressure, or in other words, tension) have been reported using water processed to remove dissolved gases.

The linguistic core of the Bantu languages, which comprise a branch of the Niger\u2013Congo family, was located in the adjoining regions of Cameroon and Nigeria. However, attempts to trace the exact route of the expansion, to correlate it with archaeological evidence and genetic evidence, have not been conclusive; thus although the expansion is widely accepted as having taken place, many aspects of it remain in doubt or are highly contested.\n\nThe expansion is believed to have taken place in at least two waves, between about 3,000 and 2,000 years ago (approximately 1,000 BC to 1 AD).

They ranked below universities, but above Colleges of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) which offer trade qualification. CAEs were designed to provide formal post-secondary qualifications of a more vocational nature than those available from universities, chiefly in such areas as teaching, nursing, accountancy, fine art and information technology.\n\nDescription \nColleges of Advanced Education were similar in ideals and physical facilities to Australian universities of the period, but were state owned and controlled instead of federally funded and independent. CAEs offered shorter courses, such as certificates and diplomas, and were initially excluded from awarding degrees, which were the purview of the universities. Through the mid-1980s onwards, many CAEs offered bachelor degree courses. Additionally, their staff, who were not required to undertake research, were generally on lower pay scales than their university counterparts.\n\nCAEs were designed to complement universities, forming a binary system modelled on that of the United Kingdom.

Spared the horrors of the death camps, the Jewish \"Kinder\" were uprooted, separated from their parents and transported to a different culture where they faced, not the unmitigated horror of the death camps, but a very human mixture of kindness, indifference, occasional exploitation, and the selflessness of ordinary people faced with needy children. Eva Schlesinger, daughter of Helga and Werner, is sent away to live with a foster carer in Manchester, England, temporarily until her parents find work and move to England too. She lives with Lil, a woman who has two other children (Nora and Margaret) and is married to Jack.

The surname continued in England. Today, a wide variety of locations and institutions are named Belknap or Belnap, all of which are believed to be connected in some manner to this early Puritan emigrant to America.

{"text": "Model transformation language\n\nA model transformation language in systems and software engineering is a language intended specifically for model transformation.\n\nOverview \nThe notion of model transformation is central to model-driven development. A model transformation, which is essentially a program which operates on models, can be written in a general-purpose programming language, such as Java. However, special-purpose model transformation languages can offer advantages, such as syntax that makes it easy to refer to model elements. For writing bidirectional model transformations, which maintain consistency between two or more models, a specialist bidirectional model transformation language is particularly important, because it can help avoid the duplication that would result from writing each direction of the transformation separately. \n\nCurrently, most model transformation languages are being developed in academia.

{"text": "Extraposition\n\nExtraposition is a mechanism of syntax that alters word order in such a manner that a relatively \"heavy\" constituent appears to the right of its canonical position. Extraposing a constituent results in a discontinuity and in this regard, it is unlike shifting, which does not generate a discontinuity. The extraposed constituent is separated from its governor by one or more words that dominate its governor. Two types of extraposition are acknowledged in theoretical syntax: standard cases where extraposition is optional and it-extraposition where extraposition is obligatory. Extraposition is motivated in part by a desire to reduce center embedding by increasing right-branching and thus easing processing, center-embedded structures being more difficult to process. Extraposition occurs frequently in English and related languages.\n\nExamples\nStandard cases of extraposition are optional, although at times the extraposed version of the sentence is strongly preferred. The following pairs of sentences illustrate \"normal\" word order first followed by the same sentence with extraposition:\n\na. Someone who we don't know left a message.\nb.

{"text": "Oi Yoi Yoi\n\nOi Yoi Yoi is a 1963 oil painting by British painter Roger Hilton.  Perhaps Hilton's best-known work, it is a free composition depicting a naked white woman.  The central figure is abstracted, with simple black outlines drawn in charcoal of a featureless face, breasts and pubic triangle, and upraised arms.  All four limbs are cut off at the edges of the frame.  The white body contrasts with bold segments of background colour in yellow and red, blue and black.  The work is inscribed on the back \"Oi, yoi, yoi/Hilton/Dec 63\".\n\nAccording to Hilton, the painting was inspired by a drunken argument with his second wife, Rose Hilton, who was dancing on a verandah, nude, shouting \"oi yoi yoi\", an expression of frustration or exasperation.  According to his wife, the argument took place in France in the summer of 1962, before they were married.  Hilton has rejected the suggestion that he took conscious inspiration from paintings of dancers and bathers by C\u00e9zanne or Matisse, but admitted they were \"probably subconsciously\" important.\n\nThe painting was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1964.

It may have been adopted as a slave name from one of Harry's masters or referred to his livelihood in Baltimore before meeting Bishop Asbury.\n\nThe spelling \"Hoosier\" caused William Piersen, a history professor at Fisk University, to argue for a connection to the Indiana demonym \"Hoosier\".

Perry explained that he had always wanted to front a band of this style since he was an adolescent and listened to groups such as the New York Dolls, The Stooges, Sweet and T. Rex. Having experimented with glam rock under the production supervision of Tony Visconti for the Daddies' 2000 single \"Diamond Light Boogie\", Perry was inspired to pursue the idea further. In a nod to the extravagant and outlandish fashion of glam rock (and perhaps the early years of the Daddies), i.e. feather boas and other such androgynous attire, White Hot Odyssey was styled around Louis XIV powdered wigs and knee-length pantaloons.\n\nThe band originally formed as \"Vagiant\", playing their first show in early 2003 as an"}

{"text": "Latxa\n\nThe Latxa (; ) is a breed of domestic sheep native to the Basque Country of Spain. Mostly contained within the provinces of Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Navarre, Latxa are dairy sheep whose unpasteurized milk is used to produce Idiaz\u00e1bal and Roncal cheeses. There are two sub-types of the breed, a dark-faced and a blonde. \n\nThe breed is a medium or small-sized sheep with long, coarse wool.

{"text": "Plant use of endophytic fungi in defense\n\nPlant use of endophytic fungi in defense occurs when endophytic fungi, which live symbiotically with the majority of plants by entering their cells , often fungus or bacteruim , are utilized as an indirect defense against herbivores. In exchange for carbohydrate energy resources, the fungus provides benefits to the plant which can include increased water or nutrient uptake and protection from phytophagous insects, birds or mammals. Once associated, the fungi alter nutrient content of the plant and enhance or begin production of secondary metabolites. The change in chemical composition acts to deter herbivory by insects, grazing by ungulates and/or oviposition by adult insects. Endophyte-mediated defense can also be effective against pathogens and non-herbivory damage.\n\nThis differs from other forms of indirect defense in that the fungi live within the plant cells and directly alter their physiology. In contrast, other biotic defenses such as predators or parasites of the herbivores consuming a plant are normally attracted by volatile organic compounds (known as semiochemicals) released following damage or by food rewards and shelter produced by the plant. These defenders vary in the time spent with the plant: from long enough to oviposit to remaining there"}

At that stage, the knot is slippery and easy to adjust.  The knot can be \"locked\" by making one or more overhand knots with the loose ends in the manner of a reef knot.\n\nThe sizes of the two loops can also be fixed by making half hitches with each end over the necks of the loops.

The former formalism represent the data structures aspects, while the latter stands for the behavioral and concurrent aspects of systems. In order to deal with large specifications some structuring capabilities have been introduced. The object-oriented paradigm has been adopted, which means that a CO-OPN specification is a collection of objects which interact concurrently. Cooperation between the objects is achieved by means of a synchronization mechanism, i.e., each object event may request to be synchronized with some methods (parameterized events) of one or a group of partners by means of a synchronization expression.\n\nA CO-OPN specification consists of a collection of two different modules: the abstract data type modules and the object modules. The abstract data type modules concern the data structure component of the specifications, and many sorted algebraic specifications are used when describing these modules.

For this second sort of modules, an algebraic net formalism has been adopted. Algebraic Petri nets, a kind of high level nets,"}

Much of the history was in verse; chief among which were the works of Horace and Virgil. Until the peace of the Church, early in the fourth century, the value and use of classical studies were unquestioned. Converts to Christianity brought with them such mental cultivation as they had received while pagans. They used their knowledge of mythology and ancient traditions as a means of attacking paganism. Tertullian forbade Christians to teach, but admitted that school attendance by Christian pupils was unavoidable. Arnobius, Lactantius, and Cassianus were classical Christian teachers.\n\nDuring the fourth century the value of secular literature began to be questioned by Biblical scholars. This opposition is condensed in the accepted translation, dating from Jerome from Psalm 70:15-16  Quoniam non cognovi litteraturam, introibo in potentias Domini; Domine memorabor justitiae tuae solius.

These include the Lobry\u2013de Bruyn\u2013van Ekenstein transformation, the Heyns and Amadori rearrangements, and the Voight and Bilik reactions. \u03b1-hydroxy imines may also undergo the rearrangement, although the thermodynamic driving force to amino ketones is often weak (in the absence of protic acids; see below).\n\nAdvantages: Large thermodynamic energy differences between reactants and products can be harnessed to drive these reactions to completion. Reaction progress can also be influenced through conformational control and often exhibit asymmetric induction.\n\nDisadvantages: Because the reaction is reversible and thermodynamically controlled, it"}

In 1808, the British whaling ship Scorpion, under the command of Captain Tristan Bunker, arrived at the Chilean coast with the stated purpose of whaling.

{"text": "Cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch\n\nCyclic di-GMP-I riboswitches are a class of riboswitch that specifically bind cyclic di-GMP, which is a second messenger that is used in a variety of microbial processes including virulence, motility and biofilm formation.  Cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitches were originally identified by bioinformatics as a conserved RNA-like structure called the \"GEMM motif\".  These riboswitches are present in a wide variety of bacteria, and are most common in Clostridia and certain varieties of Proteobacteria.  The riboswitches are present in pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, Vibrio cholerae (which causes cholera) and Bacillus anthracis (which causes anthrax).  Geobacter uraniumreducens is predicted to have 30 instances of this riboswitch in its genome.  A bacteriophage that infects C. difficile is predicted to carry a cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch, which it might use to detect and exploit the physiological state of bacteria that it infects.\n\nThe discovery of this riboswitch class answers the question of how genes are regulated in response to cyclic di-GMP levels in many different bacteria.  However, some bacteria in which cyclic di-GMP has been studied lack cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitches, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitches are the first kind of riboswitch to be discovered whose role is not primarily in regulating metabolism,"}

Frederic William Maitland, author of The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, has said that \"treason is a crime [with] a vague circumference and more than one centre.\"  Early French and Anglo-Saxon laws for the prosecution of persons deemed traitorous were inspired by, and in some cases, directly pulled from, late Roman and Germanic conceptions of the crime. It would be the common laws of this time period which would most directly influence those customary in King Arthur's court \u2014 assuming its existence is founded in more than the legends and fables of medieval romances.\n\nThe origins of the word treason, as speakers of English would recognize it, date to the 13th century.

The process of conviction, trial, and sentencing of traitors such as Lancelot or Mordred in Arthurian literature was greatly informed by the very real, very gruesome practices of both French and English courts,"}

{"text": "Principle of univariance\n\nThe principle of univariance states that one and the same visual receptor cell can be excited by different combinations of wavelength and intensity, so that the brain cannot know the color of a certain point of the retinal image. One individual photoreceptor type can therefore not differentiate between a change in wavelength and a change in intensity. Thus the wavelength information can be extracted only by comparing the responses across different types of receptors. The principle of univariance was first described by W. A. H.

For example, a coloured light may vary in both wavelength and in luminance. However, the brain's cells can only vary in the rate at which action potentials are fired. Therefore, a cell tuned to red light may respond the same to a bright red light as to a dim yellow light. To avoid this, the response of multiple cells is compared.\n\nReferences"}

{"text": "Uranium tailings\n\nUranium tailings are a waste byproduct (tailings) of uranium mining. In mining, raw uranium ore is brought to the surface and crushed into a fine sand. The valuable uranium-bearing minerals are then removed via heap leaching with the use of acids or bases, and the remaining radioactive sludge, called \"uranium tailings\", is stored in huge impoundments. A short ton (907\u00a0kg) of ore yield one to five pounds (0.45 to 2.3\u00a0kg) of uranium depending on the uranium content of the mineral. Uranium tailings can retain up to 85% of the ore's original radioactivity.\n\nIf uranium tailings are stored aboveground and allowed to dry out, the radioactive sand can be carried great distances by the wind, entering the food chain and bodies of water. The danger posed by such sand dispersal is uncertain at best given the dilution effect of dispersal. The majority of tailing mass will be inert rock, just as it was in the raw ore before the extraction of the uranium, but physically altered, ground up, mixed with large amounts of water and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, which can substantially alter chemical behaviour.\n\nUranium tailings contain over a dozen radioactive nuclides, which are the primary"}

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. It is a noteworthy product of Depression-era relief work.\n\nHistory\nIn 1893, a steel truss bridge was constructed to carry Bellaire's main north-south street over the Intermediate River. By 1931, with the tourism boom in northern Michigan, the bridge needed replacement. The Michigan State Highway Department drafted plans, and in late 1931 awarded Jackson contractor L. W. Lamb a $21,419 contract for the concrete construction. The Fort Pitt Bridge Works of Massillon, Ohio provided the structural steel.  Work on the bridge began in late 1931, with many workers provided by the County Relief Committee.  The bridge opened for traffic in June 1932.  The original balusters have at some points been replaced with replicas.\n\nDescription\nThe M-88\u2013Intermediate River Bridge is  long and  wide, with a roadway width of  and sidewalks lining both edges.  It has concrete balustrade railings with square balusters and posts, and an ornamental railing on one wing wall to protect pedestrians from the steep drop.

{"text": "Russian copulation\n\nIn cryptography, Russian copulation is a method of rearranging plaintext before encryption so as to conceal stereotyped headers, salutations, introductions, endings, signatures, etc.. This obscures clues for a cryptanalyst, and can be used to increase cryptanalytic difficulty in naive cryptographic schemes (however, most modern schemes contain more rigorous defences; see ciphertext indistinguishability). This is of course desirable for those sending messages and wishing them to remain confidential. Padding is another technique for obscuring such clues.\n\nThe technique is to break the starting plaintext message into two parts and then to invert the order of the parts (similar to circular shift). This puts all endings and beginnings (presumably the location of most boilerplate phrases) \"somewhere in the middle\" of the version of the plaintext that is actually encrypted. For some messages, mostly those not in a human language (e.g., images or tabular data), the decrypted version of the plaintext will present problems when reversing the inversion. For messages expressed in ordinary language, there is sufficient redundancy that the inversion can almost always be reversed by a human immediately on inspection.\n\nThe English phrase suggests that it originally came from an observation about Russian cryptographic practice.

{"text": "Remote pickup unit\n\nA remote pickup unit or RPU is a radio system using special radio frequencies set aside for electronic news gathering (ENG) and remote broadcasting.  It can also be used for other types of point-to-point radio links.\n\nAn RPU is used to send program material from a remote location to the broadcast station or network.  Usually these systems use specialized, high audio fidelity radio equipment.  One manufacturer, Marti, was best known for manufacturing remote pickup equipment, so much so that the name is usually used to refer to a remote pickup unit regardless of who the actual equipment manufacturer actually is.  \n\nToday much of the remote broadcast use digital audio system fed over ISDN telephone lines.  This method is favored because of reliability of telephone lines versus a radio link back to the station.

It has been described as a \"farrago\" and a texte vivant, owing to the complexities of its transmission: it has been abridged, rearranged, and supplemented. The resulting compilation covers the magical properties and practical uses of gemstones, plants, and animals, and is a virtual encyclopedia of amulets; it also contains material pertinent to the history of western alchemy, and to New Testament studies, particularly in illuminating meanings of words and magico-religious practices. As a medical text, the Cyranides was held in relatively low esteem even in antiquity and the Middle Ages because of its use of vernacular language and reliance on lore rather than Hippocratic or Galenic medical theory.\n\nIn the Pseudodoxia Epidemica, Thomas Browne described the Cyranides as \"a collection out of Harpocration the Greek and sundry Arabick writers delivering not only the Naturall but Magicall propriety of things.\" Although the Cyranides was considered \"dangerous and disreputable\" in the Middle Ages, it was translated into Latin by Pascalis Romanus, a clergyman with medical expertise who was the Latin interpreter for Emperor Manuel"}

It was produced by Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft (HWK) commencing in 1943, with license production by the Heinkel firm's facilities in Jenbach, Austria.\n\nDesign and development\n\nEarly versions of the Me 163 had been powered by an earlier design running on a \"cold engine\" fueled with Z-Stoff. This fuel tended to clog the jets in the combustion chamber, causing fluctuations in power and potentially explosions. Worse, however, was the fact that the engine could not be throttled, and when the aircraft leveled off after its climb to altitude it quickly accelerated to speeds that caused serious compressibility issues. The RLM demanded that a version be developed with a throttle.\n\nDuring this period Walter has also been working with a new fuel known as C-Stoff that gave off significant heat and was thus known as the \"hot engine\".  C-Stoff was a  mix of 30% hydrazine hydrate + 57% methanol + 13% water with a small amount of potassium-copper-cyanide. The oxidizer, known as T-Stoff, consisted of an 80%-concentration hydrogen peroxide-based formulation. The two reacted violently on contact."}

It is classified in the oofamily Spheroolithidae, and was probably laid by an ornithopod dinosaur.\n\nDistribution\nGuegoolithus is known from the Early Cretaceous of Spain. It is common in the Maestrazgo Basin, dating to the lower Barremian. Fossils have been found in the Blesa, El Castellar, Camarillas, and Mirambel Formations. It has also been found at the slightly older El Hocajo, a part of the Cameros Basin which dates to the Valanginian or Hauterivian ages, up to 7 million years older than the Maestrazgo specimens.\n\nDescription\nGuegoolithus is known from over 400 fossil eggshell fragments, but no complete eggs have been found. They are very thin for spheroolithids, ranging from 0.42 to 1.5 mm in thickness. The wide range of eggshell thickness is partially due to erosion on the inner and outer surfaces of the fragments. The size and shape of the complete egg is unknown.\n\nLike other types of dinosaur eggs, the shell of Guegoolithus is made up of tightly packed crystalline units. The shell is single-layered, but the shell units appear to be have two distinct layers because they exhibit a radiating acicular crystal"}

There Bernardino came under the influences of Mattia Preti, Andrea Sacchi and Pier Francesco Mola, and of Guercino, to the extent that until the 20th century Bernardino's fresco of Aurora in Palazzo Bianchi Bandinelli was attributed to Guercino himself. Through the fast friendship that bonded him to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, whose studio he frequented, he applied that sculptor's sense of theatrical action to his own mythological and allegorical subjects. He died in Rome in 1676.\n \nIn the 19th century, Bernardino was dismissed as a tame follower of greater lights, but his painting was re-evalued in the later 20th"}

He studied organ and music theory with Hugh Archibald Clarke, and was instructed in piano by Charles H. Jarvis.  From 1889 until 1895 he served as the organist of St. Paul's Procathedral in Los Angeles; after this he returned home, teaching for one year at the Philadelphia Conservatory.  From 1896 until 1905 he taught at the Combs Conservatory of Music.  In 1900 Orem began a long association with Theodore Presser, serving as a music critic and editor for the publisher while conducting the Presser Choral Society.

{"text": "Relativistic quantum cryptography\n\nRelativistic quantum cryptography is a sub-field of quantum cryptography, in which in addition to exploiting the principles of quantum physics, the no-superluminal signalling principle of relativity theory stating that information cannot travel faster than light is exploited too. Technically speaking, relativistic quantum cryptography is a sub-field of relativistic cryptography, in which cryptographic protocols exploit the no-superluminal signalling principle, independently of whether quantum properties are used or not. However, in practice, the term relativistic quantum cryptography is used for relativistic cryptography too.\n\nHistory\nIn 1997 and 1998, some important tasks in mistrustful cryptography were shown to be impossible to achieve with unconditional security. Mayers and Lo and Chau showed that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment was impossible. Lo showed that oblivious transfer and a broad class of secure computations were also impossible to achieve with unconditional security in quantum cryptography. Moreover, Lo and Chau showed that unconditionally secure ideal quantum coin tossing was impossible too. In this context, Kent provided in 1999 the first relativistic cryptographic protocols, for bit commitment and ideal coin tossing, which overcome the assumptions made by Mayers, Lo and Chau, and achieve unconditional security. Since then, other unconditionally secure relativistic protocols for bit commitment"}

Throughout much of the 20th century, many Western countries had legislation intended to prevent adoptees and adoptive families from knowing the identities of birth parents and vice versa.

In most Western countries until the 1960s and 1970s, adoption bore with it a certain stigma as it was associated in the popular mind with illegitimacy, orphanhood, and premarital or extramarital sex.  Unmarried pregnant women were often sent elsewhere from the latter stages of pregnancy until birth, with the intent of concealing the pregnancy from family and neighbours.\n\nThe passage of legislation which solidified the secrecy of adoption for both parties was regarded as a social good: it attempted to ensure the shame associated with adoption was a one-time event and prevent disputes over the child.

{"text": "Torquoselectivity\n\nTorquoselectivity is a special kind of stereoselectivity observed in electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry, defined as \"the preference for inward or outward rotation of substituents in conrotatory\nor disrotatory electrocyclic reactions.\" Torquoselectivity is not to be confused with the normal diastereoselectivity seen in pericyclic reactions, as it represents a further level of selectivity beyond the Woodward-Hoffman rules. The name derives from the idea that the substituents in an electrocyclization appear to rotate over the course of the reaction, and thus selection of a single product is equivalent to selection of one direction of rotation (i.e. the direction of torque on the substituents). The concept was originally developed by Kendall N. Houk.\n\nFor ring closing reactions, it is an example of enantioselectivity, wherein a single enantiomer of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material. In a typical electrocyclic ring closing, selection for either conrotatory or disrotatory reactions modes still produces two enantiomers. Torquoselectivity is a discrimination between these possible enantiomers that requires asymmetric induction.\n\nTorquoselectivity is also used to describe selective electrocyclic ring openings, in which different directions of rotation produce distinct structural isomers. In these cases, steric strain is often the driving"}

{"text": "Gender paradox\n\nThe gender paradox is a sociolinguistic phenomenon first observed by William Labov, in which \"Women conform more closely than men to sociolinguistic norms that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men when they are not.\" Specifically, the \"paradox\" arises from sociolinguistic data showing that women are more likely to use prestige forms and avoid stigmatized variants than men for a majority of linguistic variables, but that they are also more likely to lead language change by using innovative forms of variables.\n\nOverview\nWilliam Labov identifies three main principles that, in combination, constitute the gender paradox. They illuminate the juxtaposing roles of women, who display both conformist and nonconformist behavior in the treatment of linguistic variables.\n\nStable linguistic variables\n\nThe first of the three principles states that \"For stable sociolinguistic variables, women show a lower rate of stigmatized variants and a higher rate of prestige variants than men.\" This principle gives the most general understanding of women's treatment of linguistic variables, in that when variables are not undergoing any change, women tend to prefer the standard form of the variable to the non-standard form.

{"text": "Planocraniidae\n\nPlanocraniidae is an extinct family of basal crocodylians known from the Paleogene of Asia, Europe and North America. The family was coined by Li in 1976, and contains two genera, Boverisuchus and Planocrania. Planocraniids were highly specialized crocodylians that were adapted to living on land. They have extensive body armor, long legs, and blunt claws resembling hooves, and are sometimes informally called \"hoofed crocodiles\". Most phylogenetic analyses (analyses of evolutionary relationships) place planocraniids in a basal position within Crocodylia. Some of these analyses find that planocraniids lie just outside Brevirostres, the group of crocodilians that includes alligators, caimans, and crocodiles but not gharials. Planocraniids are inferred to have first appeared in the Late Cretaceous, several tens of millions of years before they actually occur in the fossil record. This is because the earliest members of Brevirostres appear in the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, and Planocraniidae, being an outgroup to Brevirostres,  must have branched off before this time.\n\nPristichampsidae\nPrior to 2013 the term Pristichampsidae/Pristichampsinae was used for this group.

The Bergers were a family from Bruges that were part of a long dynasty of organ builders.\n\nDuring the French Revolutionary era, Dominique II travelled to Paris where he received music lessons from Luigi Boccherini. At his return to Bruges in 1807, he was appointed as organist at the Saint-Salvatore church and succeeded Henderyck Fromont as the official carillonneur of Bruges. In December 1808, he married Maria Huben\u00e9. The marriage remained childless. The couple took care of Louis Huben\u00e9 instead, an orphaned nephew who ended up succeeding Berger as the city carillonneur of Bruges in 1838.\n\nBerger gained some renown as a composer.

The primary function of endoV differs significantly in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as suggested by studies on the E. coli and human orthologs. In prokaryotes endoV is primarily a deoxyribonuclease involved in DNA repair of deoxyinosine introduced into the genome by deamidation of adenine bases. However, it has broad substrate specificity and can also act on other types of DNA lesions as well as on inosine-containing RNA.\n\nIn eukaryotes endoV is primarily a ribonuclease and cleaves single-stranded RNA at the 3' position relative to an inosine base, which may be present due to RNA editing by deaminase enzymes.

{"text": "Aminoacyl-tRNA\n\nAminoacyl-tRNA (also aa-tRNA or charged tRNA) is tRNA to which its cognates amino acid is chemically bonded (charged). The aa-tRNA, along with some elongation factors, deliver the amino acid to the ribosome for incorporation into the polypeptide chain that is being produced. A specific cognate amino acid is charged or aminoacylated to each tRNA by aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This matching is crucial, since it ensures that only the particular amino acid matching the anticodon of the tRNA, and in turn matching the codon of the  mRNA, is used in protein synthesis.\n\nDue to the degeneracy of the genetic code, multiple tRNAs will have the same amino acid but different codons. These different tRNAs are called isoacceptors. Under certain circumstances, non-cognate amino acids will be charged, resulting in mischarged or misaminoacylated tRNA. These mischarged tRNAs must be hydrolyzed in order to prevent incorrect protein synthesis.\n\nSynthesis\nAminoacyl-tRNA is produced in two steps. First is the adenylation of the amino acid, which forms aminoacyl-AMP:\namino acid + ATP \u2194 aminoacyl-AMP + PPi\n\nSecond, the amino acid residue is transferred to the tRNA:\naminoacyl-AMP + tRNA \u2194 aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP\n\nThe net reaction is:\namino acid + ATP + tRNA \u2194 aminoacyl-tRNA"}

One theory is that those who founded Hanton City were Loyalists, colonists who remained loyal to the king of England during the American Revolution. The theory leaves it unclear whether they were forced to live in exile by the Rhode Island Patriots or whether they chose to form an enclave of like-minded people.

He is at present considered an exemplary image of an anti-hero: uneducated, ignorant, egoistic and poor villager. Sometimes perceived as a stereotype of the uneducated, profit-driven  Bulgarian and indeed the average Balkan person, he is often seen merely as a social stereotype, a member of the Principality of Bulgaria's newly formed lower middle-class.\n\nThe archetype of the fictional character was inspired by Ganyo Somov, a rose trader from Enina (a village in the Kazanlak municipality). At the international fair in Chicago in 1893, Aleko Konstantinov met Ganyo Somov and used him to create one of the most famous Bulgarian literature characters.\n\nBay is a Bulgarian honorary title to refer to older or more influential persons: the character's first name is Ganyo, and his family name has been attested as either Ganyo Somov or Ganyo Balkanski. Bay Ganyo is the protagonist of a novel-like series of satirical feuilletons by Aleko Konstantinov. The first part of the series tells of Bay Ganyo's journeys to various European cities and compares the character's culture to that of their residents."}

{"text": "Bridgetown, Western Australia\n\nBridgetown is a town in the South West region of Western Australia, approximately  south of Perth on the Blackwood River at the intersection of South Western Highway with Brockman Highway to Nannup and Augusta.\n\nHistory\nThe area was originally known as Geegelup, which was believed to mean \"place of gilgies\" in the Noongar language, referring to the fresh water lobster that inhabits the area. However recent research suggests the actual meaning of Geegelup may be \"place of spears\".\n\nIn 1852, A.C. Gregory made the original survey of the Geegelup area and in 1857, Edward Godfrey Hester (now honoured in nearby Hester) and John Blechynden settled there. In 1861, convicts built the road from Donnybrook into the area. In 1864 the Geegelup Post Office was established in a building on Blechynden\u2019s property that also served as the police station. The first purpose-built police station was constructed on the south bank of the Blackwood River in mid 1867.\n\nThe townsite was surveyed in April 1868 by Thomas Carey, who proposed the name Bridgetown for two reasons - \"as it is at a bridge and the Bridgetown was the first ship to put in at Bunbury for the wool from"}

{"text": "Hyophorbe lagenicaulis\n\nHyophorbe lagenicaulis, the bottle palm or palmiste gargoulette, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.\nIt is native to Round Island, Mauritius.\n\nDescription\n\nBottle palm has a large swollen (sometimes bizarrely so) trunk.  It is a myth that the trunk is a means by which the palm stores water.  Bottle palms have only four to six leaves open at any time. The leaves of young palms have a red or orange tint, but a deep green is assumed at maturity. The flowers of the palm arise from under the crownshaft.\n\nThis species is often confused with its relative, the Spindle Palm, which also has a swollen trunk. However the Spindle palm's trunk swells in the middle (resembling the shape of a spindle), whereas the trunk of the Bottle palm swells from near the base and tapers further up. \nIts inflorescence branches in 4 orders, and its 2.5\u00a0cm fruits can be orange or black. The trunk of both species becomes more and more slender as the palm ages.\n\nWithin Mauritius, the only other extant Hyophorbe species is the common Hyophorbe vaughanii. The Bottle palm can be distinguished from this species however, by its swollen trunk"}

{"text": "Anna Rosmus\n\nAnna Rosmus, also known as Anja Rosmus-Wenninger, is a German author and researcher born in 1960 in Passau, Bavaria.\n\nEarly life and research \n\nAs a 16-year-old, Rosmus started developing an interest in contemporary history, especially that of the Third Reich, a subject that was barely mentioned at school. Encouraged by her father, a principal, she participated in a national essay contest that addressed the history of her city during the pre-war years. Some prominent residents claimed that the community remained untouched by the war and others praised themselves for their alleged political resistance against the dictatorship. Rosmus uncovered newspaper clippings and other archival material showing that local leaders and members of the town's prominent families, had not only been compliant but were active members of the Nazi Party long before the war, and had helped to round up the town's roughly 400 Jews to send to concentration camps. Her essay, \"My Hometown During the Third Reich\", won a prize.\n\nRosmus' efforts were not welcomed by many inhabitants but at the age of 20, she continued with her research. Upon further questioning of some of Passau's elders, Rosmus found a conspiracy of silence and refusal to provide information. After"}
