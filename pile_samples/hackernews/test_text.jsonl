Now when you\nwant to do a recursive definition, you must use \"==\" instead of the normal\n\"=\". That might sound like a pain, but bear with me, it's really great. In\nshort, the \"==\" syntax announces to the parser that you _intend_ to apply the\nfixpoint operator (Y combinator) to the definition, explicitly making it\nrecursive.\n\nFor example, here is the function which sums the numbers in a list:\n\n    \n    \n      \\sum == (\\list list 0.0 \\head\\tail double_add head; sum tail)\n    \n\nOf course, if you don't like saying double_add everywhere, you can easily\nabbreviate as follows:\n\n    \n    \n      \\add=double_add\n      \\sum == (\\list list 0.0 \\head\\tail add head; sum tail)\n    \n\nNow here's the great thing about requiring \"==\" for recursive definitions.

In other words, the startup is non-viable at the time of its\nfounding, but later events change the structure of the market in a way that\ntakes the struggling business and turns it into a growth powerhouse.\n\nGoogle, Whatsapp, Uber, Twitch, AirBnB, EverNote, Roblox, and to some extent\nApple can all be seen as examples of this.\n\nThis has a bunch of implications for what it's really like to found a startup:\nin particular, it validates the wisdom of keeping burn rate extremely low and\nof being extremely persistent, as well as having a product out there that\npeople can use. It also suggests that it may be better to have a lot of\nusable-but-unpolished working products that are constantly getting exposure\n(even if they're not succeeding), rather than putting all your eggs into\nimproving one product, and argues for putting failed startups in maintenance-\nmode rather than shuttering them entirely."}

Your app can use up only a\nrelatively small part. More accurately, each component (Activity, Service,\netc.) of your app with the <process> attribute can only use up to 48MB.\nUsually, all your components are in one process.\n\nWithin your process, Android will \"destroy\" (null all references) to\ncomponents in your process and recreate them to optimize memory use. At times,\nAndroid will destroy every component in a process and delete ane re-create\nwhole processes from the saved state of each component. This explains why PIDs\nare not reliable for tracking android app resource use. Your tasks (the\ncomponents on the back stack starting with the task root, which is the\ncomponent that was launched by the Launcher) are not tied to one process, nor\none PID, throughout their lifespan."}

Enabling VT-x extensions requires ring-0 (kernel level) API calls.\nTherefore, it is up to the kernel extension to enable these.\n\nMac OS X 10.6 and greater supports native kernel APIs for doing this[1]. Prior\nto 10.6, you'd have to directly query the CPUs and modify CPU registers\nyourself, and icky business prone to some massive failure. Native APIs are\npretty nice.
